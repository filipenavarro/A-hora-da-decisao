INTRODUCTION

No one can have looked forward to the national revolution
of this year with greater longing than myself. The
sordid Revolution of 1918 I detested from its first day, for
it was the betrayal by the inferior part of our people of
that strong, live part which had risen up in 1914 in the be-
lief that it could and would have a future. Everything of a
political nature that I have written since then has been di-
rected against the forces which had entrenched themselves,
with our enemies’ help, on the mountain of our misery and
misfortune in order to render this future impossible. Every
line that I wrote was meant to contribute to their over-
throw, and I hope that it has done so. Something had to
come in one form or another to release the deepest instincts
in our blood from that load, if we were, like others, to have
a voice and to act in the coming world-crises and not merely
be their victim. The great game of world politics is not over.
Only now are the highest stakes being played for. Every
living nation must rise to greatness or go under. But the
events of this year allow us to hope that the decision in our
case has not yet been made — that we, as in Bismarck’s
day, shall sooner or later again be subjects and not mere
objects of history. The decades in which we live are stu-

Stupendous — and accordingly terrifying and void of happi-
ness. Greatness and happiness are incompatible and we are 
given no choice. No one living in any part of the world of 
today will be happy, but many will be able to control by the 
exercise of their own will the greatness or insignificance of 
their life-course. As for those who seek comfort merely, 
they do not deserve to exist. 

The man of action is often limited in his vision. He is 
driven without knowing the real aim. He might possibly 
offer resistance if he did see it, for the logic of destiny has 
never taken human wishes into account. But much more 
often he goes astray because he has conjured up a false 
picture of things around and within him. It is the great task 
of the historical expert (in the true sense) to understand 
the facts of his time and through them to envisage, inter-
pret, and delineate the future — which will come whether 
we will or no. An epoch so conscious of itself as the present 
is impossible of comprehension without creative, anticipat-
ing, warning, leading criticism. 

I shall neither scold nor flatter. I refrain from forming 
any estimate of those things which are only just coming 
into being. True valuation of an event is only possible when 
it has become the remote past, and the definitive good or 
bad results have long been facts; which is to say, when some 
decades have passed. No ripe understanding of Napoleon 
was possible before the end of last century, and even we 
can as yet have no final opinion about Bismarck. Facts 
alone stand firm, judgments waver and change. In sum, a 
great event has no need of a contemporary estimate, His-

Glory itself will judge it when its contemporaries are no 
longer living. 

So much, however, can be said already: the national 
revolution of 1933 was a mighty phenomenon and will remain 
such in the eyes of the future by reason of the elemental, 
super-personal force with which it came and the 
spiritual discipline with which it was carried through. Here 
was something Prussian through and through, just as was 
the uprising of 1914, which transformed souls in one 
moment. The German “ dreamers ” stood up with a calm 
imposing naturalness to open a way into the future. But all 
the more must those who took part realize that this was no 
victory, for opponents were lacking. The force of the rising 
was such that everything that had been or was still active 
was swept away in it. It was a promise of future victories 
that have yet to be won by hard fighting, and merely cleared 
the ground for these. The leaders bear the full responsibility 
therefor, and it is for them to know, or to learn, the significance 
of it all. The task is fraught with immense dangers, 
and its sphere lies not within the boundaries of Germany 
but beyond, in the realm of wars and catastrophes where 
world politics alone speak. Germany is, more than any 
other country, bound up with the fate of all the others. 
Less than any can it be directed as though it were a thing 
unto itself. And, moreover, it is not the first national revolution 
that has taken place here—there have been Cromwell 

and Mirabeau — but it is the first to occur in a politically 
helpless and very dangerously situated land, and this fact 
enhances incalculably the difficulty of its tasks.

INTRODUCTION

These tasks are, one and all, only just emerging, are
barely grasped and not solved. It is no time or occasion for
transports of triumph. Woe betide those who mistake mobilization
for victory! A movement has just begun; it has
not reached its goal, and the great problems of our time
have been in no wise altered by it. They concern not Germany
alone, but the whole world, and are problems not
of a few years, but of a century.

The danger with enthusiasts is that they envisage the
situation as too simple. Enthusiasm is out of keeping with
goals that lie generations ahead. And yet it is with these
that the actual decisions of history begin.

The seizure of power took place in a confused whirl of
strength and weakness. I see with misgiving that it continues
to be noisily celebrated from day to day. It were
better to save our enthusiasm for a day of real and definitive
results — that is to say, of successes in foreign politics,
which alone matter. When these have been achieved the
men of the moment, who took the first step, may all be dead —
or even forgotten and scorned, until at some point posterity
recalls their significance. History is not sentimental,
and it will go ill with any man who takes himself sentimentally!

In any movement with such a beginning there are
many possible developments of which the participants are
not often fully aware. The movement may become rigid
from excess of principles and theories; it may go under in
political, social, or economic anarchy, or it may double
back upon itself in futility. In Paris in 1793 it was definitely
[xiii]

INTRODUCTION

felt “que ça changerait.” The intoxication of the
moment, which often ruins coming possibilities at the outset,
is usually followed by disillusionment and uncertainty
as to the next step. Elements come into power which regard
the enjoyment of that power as an event in itself and would
fain perpetuate a state of things which is tenable for moments
only. Sound ideas are exaggerated into self-glorification
by fanatics, and that which held promise of
greatness in the beginning ends in tragedy or comedy.
Let us face these dangers in good time, and soberly,
so that we may be wiser than many a generation in the
past.

But if a stable foundation is to be laid for a great future,
one on which coming generations may build, ancient tradition
must continue effective. That which we have in our
blood by inheritance — namely, wordless ideas — is the
only thing which gives permanence to our future. “Prussianism (Preussentum)
as I called it years ago, is important — it is this, precisely, that has just been tested
— but “Socialism,” of whatever description, is not. We
need educating up to the Prussian standard, which manifested
itself in 1870 and 1914 and still sleeps in the depths
of our soul as a permanent potentiality. It is to be reached
only through the living example and moral self-discipline
of a ruling class, not by a flow of words or by force. The
service of an idea demands mastery of ourselves and readiness
for inward sacrifices to conviction. To confuse this
with the intellectual compulsion of a program is to be ignorant
of the whole issue. And this brings me back to the

INTRODUCTION

book: ‘Prussianism and Socialism,’ in which, in 1919, I
began to point out this moral necessity without which there
can be no permanent building. All other nations of the
world have inherited a character from their past. We had
no educative past and have therefore still to awaken, de-
velop, and train the character which lies dormant in our
blood.

The work of which this volume is the first part is written
with the same object. I do as I have always done. That is,

I offer no wish-picture of the future, still less a program
for its realization — as is the fashion amongst us Germans
— but a clear picture of the facts as they are and will be.

I see further than others. I see not only great possibilities
but also great dangers, their origin and perhaps the way
to avoid them. And if no one else has the courage to see
and to tell what it is he sees, I mean to do so. I have a right
to criticism since by means of it I have repeatedly demon-
strated that which must happen because it will happen. A
decisive series of facts has been set in train. Nothing that
has once become a fact can be withdrawn — we are all
thereafter obliged to walk in the particular direction,
whether we will or not. It would be short-sighted and
cowardly to say no. What the individual will not do, that
History will do with him.

But to say yes presupposes comprehension, and this book
is here to help in comprehension. It is a danger-signal.
Dangers are always there. Everyone who acts is in danger.
Danger is life itself. But those who link the fate of States

and nations with their own must meet these dangers seemingly
— and to see requires possibly the most courage of all.

The present book arose out of a lecture: Germany in
Danger,¹ which I delivered at Hamburg in 1929, without
meeting with much comprehension. In November 1932 I
began to develop the theme, still in terms of the existing
situation in Germany. By the 30th January 1933 it was
printed up to page 106. I have altered nothing in it, for I
write not for a few months ahead or for next year, but for
the future. What is true cannot be made null by an event.
The title alone I have changed, so as to avoid
misunderstandings. It is not the national seizure of power which is
a danger; the dangers were there — some of them dating
from 1918, others from much further back — and they
still persist, since they cannot be got rid of by an isolated
event which before taking effect against them must undergo
a long development in the right direction. Germany is in
danger. My fear for Germany has not grown less. The
March victory was too easy to open the eyes of the victors to
the extent of the danger, its origin, and its duration.

No one can know what forms, situations, and
personalities will arise out of this upheaval, or the reactions which
may result from outside. Every revolution makes the
external situation of a country worse, and that fact alone
requires statesmen of Bismarck’s order to deal with it. We
stand, it may be, close before a second world war, unable
to gauge the distribution of forces or to foresee its means or
aims — military, economic, revolutionary. We have no¹

time to limit ourselves to home politics; we have to be “in 
form” to deal with any conceivable occurrence. Germany 
is not an island. If we fail to see our relation to the world 
as — for us in particular — the important problem, fate — 
and what a fate! — will submerge us without mercy. 

Germany is the key country of the world, not only on 
account of her geographical situation on the borders of Asia 
(which is today the most important continent in world 
policy), but also because Germans are still young enough 
to experience world-historical problems, to form them and 
solve them, inwardly, while other nations have become too 
old and rigid to do more than raise defences. But in tackling 
great problems, as in other matters, it is the attack that 
holds the greater promise of victory. 

It is of this that I have written. Will it have the effect I 
hope for?

THE POLITICAL HORIZON

Is there today a man among the White races who has
eyes to see what is going on around him on the face of the
globe? To see the immensity of the danger which looms
over this mass of peoples? I do not speak of the educated
or uneducated city crowds, the newspaper-readers, the
herds who vote at elections — and, for that matter, there
is no longer any quality-difference between voters and those
for whom they vote — but of the ruling classes of the
White nations, in so far as they have not been destroyed, of
the statesmen in so far as there are any left; of the true
leaders of policy, of economic life, of armies, and of
thought. Does anyone, I ask, see over and beyond his time,
his own continent, his country, or even the narrow circle of
his own activities?

We live in momentous times. The stupendous dynamism
of the historical epoch that has now dawned makes it the
grandest, not only in the Faustian civilization of Western
Europe, but — for that very reason — in all world-history,
greater and by far more terrible than the ages of Caesar
and Napoleon. Yet how blind are the human beings over
whom this mighty destiny is surging, whirling them in
confusion, exalting them, destroying them! Who among them

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

sees and comprehends what is being done to them and 
around them? Some wise old Chinaman or Indian, perhaps, 
who gazes around him in silence with the stored-up thought 
of a thousand years in his soul. But how superficial, how 
narrow, how small-minded are the judgments and measures 
of Western Europe and America! What do the inhabitants 
of the Middle West of the United States know of what goes 
on beyond New York and San Francisco? What concep-
tion has a middle-class Englishman, not to speak of a 
French provincial, of the trend of affairs on the Continent? 
What, indeed, does any one of them know of the direction 
in which his very own destiny is facing? All we have is a 
number of absurd catchwords, such as “ overcoming the 
economic crisis,” “ understanding of peoples,” “ national 
security and self-sufficingness,” with which to “ overcome ” 
catastrophes within the space of a generation or two by 
means of “ prosperity ” and disarmament. 

But it is of Germany that I am speaking here; Germany, 
to whom the storm of facts is more menacing than to any 
other country and whose existence is, in the most alarming 
sense of the word, at stake. What short-sightedness and noisy 
superficiality reigns among us, and how provincial the 
standpoint when major problems emerge! Let us set up a 
ring-fenced Third Empire or, alternatively, Soviet State; 
let us do away with the army or with property, with econo-
mists, or with agriculture; Let us give maximum independ-
ence to all the little provinces, or alternatively suppress 
them; let us allow the former lords of industry or adminis-
tration to get to work again in the style of 1900, or — why

not? — let us have a revolution, proclaim a dictatorship
(are there not dozens of candidates confident of their fitness
for the job?), and all will be well.

But — Germany is not an island. No other country is
in the same degree woven actively or passively into the
world’s destiny. Her geographical situation alone, her lack
of natural boundaries, make this inevitable. In the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries she was “Central Europe”
in the twentieth she is again, as in and after the thirteenth
century, a frontier against “Asia.” For no country is it
more essential that its sphere of political and economic
thought should reach far beyond its own boundaries. Everything
that happens afar involves the heart of Germany.

Our past is having its revenge — seven hundred years
of the petty provincial regime of small states with never a
breath of greatness, an idea, an aim. This is not going to be
made good in two generations. And Bismarck’s creative
work had the one great fault that he did not train the coming
generation to meet the facts of the new form of our political
life.^1 The facts were seen, but not grasped. Men could not
inwardly adapt themselves to the new horizons, problems,
and obligations. They did not live with them. And the average
German continued to apply to his greater country the
old particularist and partisan outlook — shallow and
cramped, stupid and parochial. This small-mindedness
dates from the time of the Hohenstaufen emperors and
the Hansa. The first, whose vision ranged over the Mediterranean,
and the second, whose rule extended from the

Scheldt to Novgorod, alike fell before other and more 
securely based powers for want of wise and substantial 
backing from within their own frontiers. And from that 
time on, the German has shut himself up in innumerable 
little fatherlands and petty local interests, measuring world 
history by his own horizon, and dreaming hungrily and 
miserably of a kingdom in the clouds — to describe which 
condition the phrase “ German idealism ” was invented. 
To this petty and essentially German mode of thought be-
long almost all the political ideals and Utopias that have 
sprouted from the bog of the Weimar State: the Inter-
national, Communist, Pacifist, Ultramontane, Federal, 
“ Aryan ” visions of sacrum imperium, Soviet State, or 
Third Empire, as the case might be. All parties now think 
and act as if Germany had the world to herself. Trade 
unions see no further than the industrial area. Colonial 
policy has always been odious to them because it does not 
fit in with the scheme of class war. In their dogmatic nar-
rowness they do not, or will not, comprehend that it was 
precisely the working man for whom the economic im-
perialism of the years round 1900, with its assured facili-
ties for the sale of products and the purchase of raw 
materials, was the basic premise of existence. This the 
English workman had long before grasped. The enthusiasm 
of German democracy for disarmament stops short at the 
frontiers of the French sphere of power. The Federalists 
would have their already greatly reduced country split 
up again into a bundle of dwarf states of the old sort, 
thereby giving foreign powers the opportunity to play off

one against the other. And the National Socialists believe 
that they can afford to ignore the world or oppose it, and 
build their castles-in-the-air without creating a possibly 
silent, but very palpable reaction from abroad.

Added to all this is the universal dread of reality. We 
“ pale-faces ” have it, all of us, although we are seldom, 
and most of us never, conscious of it. It is the spiritual 
weakness of the “ Late ” man of the higher civilizations, 
who lives in his cities cut off from the peasant and the 
soil and thereby from the natural experiencing of destiny, 
time, and death. He has become too wide awake, too ac- 
customed to ponder perpetually over yesterday and to- 
morrow, and cannot bear that which he sees and is forced 
to see: the relentless course of things, senseless chance, and 
real history striding pitilessly through the centuries into 
which the individual with his tiny scrap of private life is 
irrevocably born at the appointed place. That is what he 
“longs to forget, refute, or contest. He takes flight from 
history into solitude, into imaginary far-away systems, 
into some faith or another, or into suicide. Like a grotesque 
ostrich he buries his head in hopes, ideals, and cowardly 
optimism: it is so, but it ought not to be, therefore it is 
otherwise. We sing in the woods at night because we are 
afraid. Similarly, the cowardice of cities shouts its ap- 
parent optimism to the world at large for very fear. Reality 
is no longer to be borne. The wish-picture of the future 
is set in place of facts — although fate has never taken

any notice of human fancies — from the children’s Land 
of Do-Nothing to the World Peace and Workers’ Paradise 
of the grown-ups. 

Little as one knows of events in the future — for all that 
can be got from a comparison with other civilizations is the 
general form of future facts and their march through 
the ages — so much is certain: the forces which will sway 
the future are no other than those of the past. These forces 
are: the will of the Strong, healthy instincts, race, the will 
to possession and power; while justice, happiness, and 
peace — those dreams which will always remain dreams 
— hover ineffectively over them. 

Further, in our own civilization since the sixteenth century 
it has rapidly grown more impossible for most of us 
to gain a general view of the ever more confusing events 
and situations of world politics and economics or to grasp 
(let alone control) the forces and tendencies at work in 
them. True statesmen become rarer and rarer. Most of the 
doings (as distinct from the events) in the history of these 
centuries was indeed the work of semi-experts and amateurs 
with luck on their side. Still, they could always rely upon 
the people’s instinct to back them. It is only now that this 
instinct has become so weak, and the voluble criticism 
of blithe ignorance so strong, as to make it more and more 
likely that a true statesman, with a real knowledge of 
things, will not receive the instinctive support — even at 
the level of grudging tolerance — but will be prevented 
from doing what has to be done by the opposition of all 
the “know-betters.” Frederick the Great experienced the

first of these types of opposition; Bismarck almost fell a 
victim to the second. Only later generations, and not even 
they, can appreciate the grandeur and creativeness of 
such leaders. But we do have to see to it that the present 
confines itself to ingratitude and incomprehension and 
does not proceed to counteraction. Germans in particular 
are great at suspecting, criticizing, and voiding creative 
action. They have none of that historical experience and 
force of tradition which are congenital with English life. 
A nation of poets and thinkers — in the process of becoming 
a nation of babblers and persecutors. Every real governor 
is unpopular among his frightened, cowardly, and 
uncomprehending contemporaries. And one must be more 
than an “idealist” to understand even this. 

We are still in the Age of Rationalism, which began in the 
eighteenth century and is now rapidly nearing its close.^ 
We all are its creatures whether we know and wish it or not. 
The word is familiar enough, but who knows how much it 
implies? It is the arrogance of the urban intellect, which, 
detached from its roots and no longer guided by strong 
instinct, looks down with contempt on the full-blooded 
thinking of the past and the wisdom of ancient peasant 
stock. It is the period in which everyone can read and 
write and therefore must have his say and always “knows 
better.” This type of mind is obsessed by concepts — the 
new gods of the Age — and exercises its wits on the 
world as it sees it. “It is no good,” it says; “we could 
make it better; here goes, let us set up a program for a

better world!” Nothing could be easier for persons of 
intelligence, and no doubt seems to be felt that this world 
will then materialize of itself. It is given a label, “Human 
Progress,” and now that it has a name, it is. Those who 
doubt it are narrow reactionaries, heretics, and, what is 
worse, persons devoid of democratic virtue: away with 
them! In this wise the fear of reality was overcome by 
intellectual arrogance, the darkness that comes from 
ignorance of all things of life, spiritual poverty, lack of 
reverence, and, finally, world-alien stupidity — for there 
is nothing stupider than the rootless urban intelligence. 
In English offices and clubs it used to be called common 
sense; in French salons, esprit; in German philosophers’ 
studies. Pure Reason. The shallow optimism of the 
cultural philistine is ceasing to fear the elemental historical 
facts and beginning to despise them. Every “know-better” 
seeks to absorb them in his scheme (in which experience 
has no part), to make them conceptually more complete 
than actually they are, and to subordinate them to himself 
in his mind because he has not livingly experienced them, 
but only perceived them. This doctrinaire clinging to theory 
for lack of experience, or rather this lack of ability to make 
experience, finds literary expression in a flood of schemes 
for political, social, and economic systems and Utopias, 
and practical expression in that craze for organization 
which, becoming an aim in itself, produces bureaucracies 
that either collapse through their own hollowness or 
destroy the living order. Rationalism is at bottom nothing but 
criticism, and the critic is the reverse of a creator; he

dissects and he reassembles; conception and birth are alien 
to him. Accordingly his work is artificial and lifeless, and 
when brought into contact with real life, it kills. All these 
systems and organizations are paper productions; they 
are methodical and absurd and live only on the paper they 
are written on. The process began at the time of Rousseau 
and Kant with philosophical ideologies that lost themselves 
in generalities; passed in the nineteenth century to scientific 
constructions with scientific, physical, Darwinian methods — 
sociology, economics, materialistic history-writing — 
and lost itself in the twentieth in the literary output of 
problem novels and party programs. 

But let there be no mistake: idealism and materialism 
are equally parts of it. Both are Rationalist through and 
through, in the case of Kant as of Voltaire and Holbach; 
of Novalis as of Proudhon; of the ideologues of the Wars 
of Liberation as of Marx; of the materialist conception of 
history quite as much as the idealistic, whether the meaning 
and aim of it is “ progress,” technics, “ liberty,” 
the “happiness of the greatest number,” or the flowering 
of art, poetry, and thought. In both cases there is the failure 
to realize that destiny in history depends on quite other, 
robuster forces. Human history is war history. Among 
the few genuine historians of standing, none was ever 
popular, and among statesmen Bismarck achieved popularity 
only when it was of no more use to him. 

But Romanticism too, with its lack of a sense for 
reality, is just as much an expression of rationalist arrogance 
as are Idealism and Materialism. They are all in

fact closely related, and it would be difficult to discover
the boundary between these two trends of thought in any
political or social Romantic. In every outstanding Materialist
a Romantic lies hidden.^ Though he may scorn the cold,
shallow, methodical mind of others, he has himself enough
of that sort of mind to do so in the same way and with the
same arrogance. Romanticism is no sign of powerful instincts,
but, on the contrary, of a weak, self-detesting intellect.
They are all infantile, these Romantics; men who
remain children too long (or for ever), without the strength
to criticize themselves, but with perpetual inhibitions arising
from the obscure awareness of their own personal weakness;
who are impelled by the morbid idea of reforming
society, which is to them too masculine, too healthy, too
sober. And to reform it, not with knives and revolvers in
the Russian fashion — heaven forbid! — but by noble
talk and poetic theories. Hapless indeed they are if, lacking
creative power, they lack also the artistic talent to
persuade at least themselves that they possess it. Yet even
in their art they are feminine and weak, incapable of setting
a great novel or a great tragedy on its legs, still less
a pure philosophy of any force. All that appears is spineless
lyric, bloodless scenarios, and fragmentary ideas, all
of them displaying an innocence of and antagonism to the
world which amounts to absurdity. But it was the same with
the unfading “Youths” (Jünglinge), with their “old German”
coats and pipes— Jahn and Arndt, even, included.

1 Haeckel’s Riddle of the Universe, for instance, is the work of a pure
Sentimentalist and a weak logician. A faith that is stronger than any proofs
is the distinguishing mark of the Romantic,

Stein himself was unable to control his romantic taste for 
ancient constitutions sufficiently to allow him to turn his 
extensive practical experience to successful account in diplomacy. 
Oh, they were heroes, and noble, and ready to be martyrs at any 
moment; but they talked too much about German nature and too 
little about railways and customs unions, and thus became only 
an obstacle in the way of Germany’s real future. Did they ever so 
much as hear the name of the great Friedrich List, who committed 
suicide in 1846 because no one understood and supported his farsighted 
and modern political aim, the building of an economic Germany? 
But they all knew the names of Arminius and Thusnelda. 

And these same everlasting “Youths” are with us again today, 
immature, destitute of the slightest experience or even real desire 
for experience, but writing and talking away about politics, fired 
by uniforms and badges, and clinging fantastically to some theory 
or other. There is a social Romanticism of sentimental Communists, 
a political Romanticism which regards election figures and the intoxication 
of mass-meeting oratory as deeds, and an economic Romanticism 
which trickles out from behind the gold theories of sick minds that 
know nothing of the inner forms of modern economics. They can 
only feel in the mass, where they can deaden the dull sense of their weakness 
by multiplying themselves. And this they call the Overcoming of 
Individualism.

Burke, on the contrary, like a true statesman, argued that 
on his side of the Channel men demanded their due as 
Englishmen and not as human beings, and he was right. 
This was practical political thinking, not the rationalistic 
issue of undisciplined emotions. For this evil sentimentality 
which lies over all the theoretical currents of the two centuries — Liberalism, Communism, Pacifism, — and all the 
books, speeches, and revolutions, originates in spiritual 
indiscipline, in personal weakness, in lack of the training 
imparted by a stern old tradition. It is “bourgeois” or 
“plebeian,” in so far as these are terms of abuse. It looks 
at human things, history, and political destiny from below, 
meanly, from the cellar window, the street, the writers’ 
cafe, the national assembly; not from height and distance. 
It detests every kind of greatness, everything that towers, 
rules, is superior; and construction means for it only the 
pulling-down of all the products of civilization, of the 
State, of society, to the level of little people, above which 
its pitiful emotionalism cannot soar to understand. That 
is all that the prefix “folk” or “people” means today, 
for the “people” in the mouth of any Rationalist 
or Romanticist does not mean the well-formed nation, 
shaped and graded by Destiny in the course of ages, 
but that portion of the dull formless mass which everyone 
senses as his equals, from the “proletariat” to 
“humanity.”

understanding things as they are, Scepticism — fundamental 
doubt as to the meaning and value of theoretical reflection, 
as to its ability to arrive at conclusions by critical 
and abstract methods or to achieve anything by practical 
ones; Scepticism in the form of great historical and physiognomic 
experience, of the incorruptible eye for facts, the 
real knowledge of men which teaches what they were and 
are and not what they ought to be; the Scepticism of true 
historical thought which teaches, amongst other things, that 
there have been other periods wherein criticism was all-
powerful and that these periods have left little impression behind 
them; and the Scepticism which brings reverence for 
the facts of world happening, which are and remain inward 
secrets to be described but never explained, and to be mastered 
only by men of a strong breed who are themselves historical 
facts, not by sentimental programs and systems. The 
hard recognition of historical fact which has set in with this 
century is intolerable to soft, uncontrolled natures. They 
detest those who establish them, calling them pessimists. 
Well, but this strong pessimism, with which belongs the 
contempt for mankind of all great fact-men who know mankind, 
is quite a different matter from the cowardly pessimism 
of small and weary souls which fear life and cannot 
bear to look at reality. The life they hope for, spent in 
peace and happiness, free from danger and replete with 
comfort, is boring and senile, apart from the fact that it 
is only imaginable, not possible. On this rock, the reality 
of history, every ideology must founder.

As regards the international situation of the moment, we 
are all in danger of misreading it. After the American 
Civil War (1861-5), the Franco-German War (1870-1), 
and the Victorian Age, existence and progress among the 
White races ran so incredibly calm, secure, peaceful, and 
care-free that one may search in vain through the centuries 
for anything analogous. Anyone who has lived 
through that period, or even heard about it from others, 
is always liable to regard it as normal and the wild present 
as a disturbance of this natural state of affairs, and to 
wish that things may soon “ look up again.” Now, that 
will not be the case, and we shall never see that kind of 
thing again. We do not realize what led up to this, in the 
long run, impossible situation. There was the fact that 
standing and expanding armies rendered a war so incalculable 
that no statesman any longer dared to make one; 
the fact that technical economic development was in a 
feverish condition which was bound to come to a speedy 
end because of its dependence on rapidly vanishing conditions; 
and, finally, the resultant fact that the grave unsolved 
problems of the time were being pushed more and 
more into the future, loaded as an unavowed commitment 
on to the shoulders of the heirs and heirs’ heirs, so successfully 
that men cease to believe in their reality although 
they were looming out of the future with steadily 
growing insistence,

soul, none can stand a long peace. This peace period from
1870 to 1914, and the memory of it, rendered all White
men self-satisfied, covetous, void of understanding, and
incapable of bearing misfortune. We see the result in the
Utopian conceptions and challenges which today form part
of every demagogue’s program; challenges to the age, to
the State, to parties, and in fact to “everyone else,” in
complete disregard of the limits of possibility or of duty,
doing, and forgoing.

This all too long peace over a period of growing excitement
is a fearful inheritance. Not a statesman, not
a party, hardly even a political thinker is today in a safe
enough position to speak the truth. They all lie, they all
join in the chorus of the pampered, ignorant crowd who
want their tomorrow to be like the good old days, only
more so — although statesmen and economic leaders at
least ought to be alive to the frightful reality. Only look
at our leaders of today! Once a month their cowardly and
dishonest optimism announces the “upturn of the
cycle” and “prosperity,” on the strength of a mere flutter
on the stock exchange caused by building speculations:
the end of unemployment, from the moment that a hundred
men or so are given jobs, and as the climax the achievement
of “mutual understanding between the nations,” as
soon as the League — that swarm of parasitic holiday-
makers on the Lake of Geneva — has formulated any sort
of a resolution. And in every conference and every paper
the word “crisis” is bandied about in connexion with

Deceive ourselves, blind to the fact that we have here one 
of those incalculable great catastrophes that are the normal 
form in which history takes its major turns. 

For we live in a mighty age. It is the greatest that the 
Western Civilization has ever known or will know. It cor-
responds to the Classical Age from Cannae to Actium, to 
the age illumined by the names of Hannibal, Scipio, and 
Gracchus, Marius, Sulla, and Caesar.^ The World War was 
but the first flash and crash from the fateful thundercloud 
which is passing over this century. As then, at the com-
mencement of the Imperium Romanum, so today, the form 
of the world is being remoulded from its foundations, re-
gardless of the desires and intentions of “the majority” 
or of the number of victims demanded by every such 
decision. But who understands this? Who is facing it? 
Does one of us consider himself lucky to be there to see 
it? The age is mighty, but all the more diminutive are the 
people in it. They can no longer bear tragedy, either on 
the stage or in real life. They crave happy endings of 
insipid novels, so miserable and weary are they. But the 
destiny which pitched them into these decades now takes 
them by the collar and does with them what has to be 
done, whether they will or no. The coward’s security of 
1900 is at an end. Life in danger, the real life of history, 
comes once more into its own. Everything has begun to 
slide, and now only that man counts who can take risks, 
who has the courage to see and accept things as they are. 
The age is approaching — nay, is already here — which

has no more room for soft hearts and weak ideals. The
primeval barbarism which has lain hidden and bound for
centuries under the form-rigour of a ripe Culture, is awake
again now that the Culture is finished and the Civilization
has set in: that warlike, healthy joy in one's own strength
which scorns the literature-ridden age of Rationalist
thought, that unbroken race-instinct, which desires a different
life from one spent under the weight of books and
bookish ideals. In the Western European peasantry this
spirit still abounds, as also on the American prairies and
away in the great plains of northern Asia, where world-
conquerors are born.

If this is "Pessimism," then he who feels it to be so must
be one who needs the pious falsehood or veil of ideals
and Utopias to protect and save him from the sight of
reality. This, no doubt, is the refuge resorted to by most
white men in this century — but will it be so in the next?
Their forefathers in the time of the Great Migration and
the Crusades were different. They contemned such an
attitude as cowardly. It is from this cowardice in the face
of life that Buddhism and its offshoots arose in the Indian
Culture at the corresponding stage in time. These cults
are now becoming fashionable with us. It is possible that
a Late religion of the West is in process of formation
— whether under the guise of Christianity or not none
can tell, but at any rate the religious "revival" which
succeeds Rationalism as a world philosophy does hold
quite special possibilities of new religions emerging. People

engage in something which by reason of its miraculous doctrines 
and customs is better able to rock them into the 
sleep of oblivion than the Christian churches. The credo 
quia absurdum is again uppermost, but the profundity 
of world-suffering — a feeling that is as old as the brooding 
over the world itself, the moan over the absurdity of 
history and the cruelty of existence — arises not from 
things themselves, but from morbid reflection on them. 
It is the annihilating judgment upon the worth and the 
strength of men’s own souls. A profound view of the world 
need not necessarily be saturated with tears. 

There is a Nordic world-feeling, reaching from England 
to Japan, which is full of joy just because of the burden 
of human destiny. One challenges it for the sake of conquering 
it, and one goes under proudly should it prove 
stronger than one’s own will. This was the attitude depicted 
in the old, genuine parts of the Mahabharata which 
tell of the fight between the Kurus and Pandus; in Homer, 
Pindar, and Aeschylus; in the Germanic sagas and in 
Shakespeare; in certain songs of the Chinese Shu king, 
and in the world of the Samurai. It is the tragic view of 
life, which is not yet dead, but will blossom anew in the 
future just as it blossomed in the World War. All the very 
great poets of the Nordic Cultures have been tragedians, 
and tragedy, from ballad and epic onward, has been the 
deepest form of this brave pessimism. The man who is incapable 
of experiencing or enduring tragedy can never 
be a figure of world significance. He cannot make history, 
unless he experiences it as it really is— tragic, permeated

by destiny, and in consequence meaningless, aimless, and 
unmoral in the eyes of the worshippers of utility. It marks 
the parting of the ways between the superior and the 
subordinate ethos of human existence. The individual’s life 
is of importance to none besides himself: the point is 
whether he wishes to escape from history or give his life 
for it. History recks nothing of human logic. Thunderstorms, 
earthquakes, lava-streams: these are near relatives 
of the purposeless, elemental events of world history. 
Nations may go under, ancient cities of ageing Cultures 
burn or sink in ruins, but the earth will continue to revolve 
calmly round the sun, and the stars to run their 
courses. 

Man is a beast of prey.¹ I shall say it again and again. 
All the would-be moralists and social-ethics people who 
claim or hope to be “ beyond all that ” are only beasts of 
prey with their teeth broken, who hate others on account 
of the attacks which they themselves are wise enough to 
avoid. Only look at them. They are too weak to read a 
book on war, but they herd together in the street to see an 
accident, letting the blood and the screams play on their 
nerves. And if even that is too much for them, they enjoy 
it on the film and in the illustrated papers. If I call man 
a beast of prey, which do I insult: man or beast? For 
remember, the larger beasts of prey are noble creatures, 
perfect of their kind, and without the hypocrisy of human 
moral due to weakness.

In war. They are indignant when a murderer is executed for
a crime of passion, but they feel a secret pleasure in hearing
of the murder of a political opponent. What objection
have they ever raised to the Bolshevist slaughters? There
is no getting away from it: conflict is the original fact of
life, is life itself, and not the most pitiful pacifist is able
entirely to uproot the pleasure it gives his inmost soul.
Theoretically, at least, he would like to fight and destroy
all opponents of pacifism.

The further we advance into the Caesarism of the Faustian
world, the more clearly will it emerge who is destined
ethically to be the subject and who the object of historical
events. The dreary train of world-improvers has now come
to an end of its amble through these centuries, leaving
behind it, as sole monument of its existence, mountains
of printed paper. The Caesars will now take its place. High
policy, the art of the possible, will again enter upon its
eternal heritage, free from all systems and theories,
itself the judge of the facts by which it rules, and gripping
the world between its knees like a good horseman.

This being so, I have only to show here the historical
position in which Germany and the world now stand and
how this position is the inevitable outcome of the history
of past centuries, and will just as inevitably pass on to
certain forms and solutions. That is Destiny. We may
deny it, but in so doing we deny ourselves.

The “world crisis” of these years is, as the phrase itself
shows, taken far too indifferently, too lightly, or too simply,
according to the standpoint, the interests, or the horizon
of the observer. It is regarded as a crisis in production, in
unemployment, in currency, in war debts and reparations,
in home or foreign policy, and above all as the result of
the World War, which, people think, could have been
avoided by a greater degree of honesty and skill on the
diplomatists’ part. They talk, with a look askance at Germany
in particular, of the desire for war and of war
guilt. Naturally, Isvolsky, Poincare, and Grey, could
they have foreseen the condition of their countries today,
would have given up their intention of bringing about the
political result* they desired — the complete encirclement
of Germany — by the war of which the strategical introduction
was the operations in Tripoli in 1911 and the Balkans
in 1912. But even so, it is doubtful whether that mighty discharge
could have been postponed by even as much as one
decade, given the strained situation, which was not merely
political; though certainly the distribution of forces might
have been different and less grotesque. Facts are ever

For a great statesman, much narrower than the layman 
imagines. And, historically, what would have been 
changed? The form, the tempo of the catastrophe, not the 
catastrophe itself. It was the inevitable close of a century 
of Western development which had been working up 
towards it since Napoleon. 

We have entered upon the age of world wars. It began 
in the nineteenth century and will outlast the present and 
probably the next. It signifies the transition from the 
eighteenth-century world of states to the Imperium mundi. 
It corresponds to the two terrible centuries between Cannae 
and Actium, which led from the form of the Hellenistic 
world of states, of which Rome and Carthage were two, to 
the Imperium Romanum. Just as the latter embraced the 
field of the Classical civilization and its radiations — that 
is, the Mediterranean world — so will the former be the 
destiny of our globe for an indefinite period of time. 
Imperialism is an idea, whether its supporters and execu-
tors are aware of the fact or not. In our own case it may 
perhaps never be fully realized. It may be crossed by 
other ideas which come to life outside the boundaries of 
the world of the “ White ” nations, but it underlies, as 
the tendency of a great historical form, everything that 
is now going on. 

We live today “between ages.” The Western world of 
states was in the eighteenth-century a structure of a strict 
style, a style which governed also the contemporary crea- 
tions of music and mathematics,* These states and this style

expressed distinction of form not only in what they were 
but in what they did and thought. Everywhere there ruled 
an ancient and powerful tradition. There were aristocratic 
conventions of government, of opposition, of diplomatic 
and warlike interstate relations, of admission of defeat and 
of challenges and concessions at the peace table. Honour 
still played an undisputed role. Everything proceeded 
ceremoniously and politely as in a duel. 

After Peter the Great had founded a state of Western 
form at Petersburg,^ the word “Europe” began to come 
into common use among Western peoples and, as is customary, 
to slip unnoticed into practical political thought 
and the trend of history. Till then it had been a scholar’s 
term in geographical science, which since the discovery 
of America had developed on the lines of cartography. 
It is significant that the Turkish Empire, at that time a 
real world-power which embraced the whole Balkan peninsula 
and parts of southern Russia, was instinctively kept 
off these maps. And Russia itself counted actually only 
as the Petersburg Government. How many Western diplomats 
knew enough of Astrakhan, Nizhni-Novgorod, even 
Moscow, to think of them as part of “Europe”? The 
frontier of the Western civilization was always placed at 
the point where German colonization had come to a standstill. 

Of this Europe Germany formed the centre — not as a 
State, but as the battlefield of actual States. Here were 
made, mostly with German blood, the decisions as to whom

India, South Africa, and North America should belong to.
In the East lay Russia, Austria, and Turkey; in the West,
Spain and France, the two declining colonial empires
from whom the island England wrested the supremacy —
in the case of the Spaniards, definitively in 1713, in the
case of the French from 1763 onward. England became the
leading power in this system, not only as state, but as
style. She grew very rich as compared with “the Continent”
— she has never quite regarded herself as part
of “Europe” — and funded this wealth in the form of
hired soldiers, sailors, and whole states, whom she subsidized
to fight the island’s battles.

At the end of the century Spain had long ceased to be
a great power, and France was on the way to following her
example. Both were old and exhausted nations, proud but
weary, looking towards the past, but lacking the true
ambition — which is to be strictly differentiated from
jealousy — to continue to play a creative part in the future.
Mad Mirabeau’s plans of 1789 succeeded, there would have
arisen a more or less permanent constitutional monarchy,
content in essence to satisfy the rentier taste of the bourgeoisie
and the peasantry. Under the Directorate it looked
as if the country, resigned and sick of ideals as it was,
would have welcomed any form of government that would
guarantee outward and inward peace. But then came Napoleon,
an Italian who had chosen Paris as the base of his
schemes for power, and created in his armies the type of the
last Frenchman, who upheld France as a great power for
fully a century — a type brave, elegant, bragging, rough,

fond of killing, plundering, destroying, all for its own
sake without any object — with the result that none of
these victories brought France the smallest permanent advantage
in spite of the incredible bloodshed. Only her
fame increased, not even her honour. At bottom it was
a Jacobin ideal, which, in contrast to the Girondist ideal of
the small business man and the philistine, had behind it
never the majority but always the power. The polite forms
of the ancien regime in politics were ousted by others
definitely plebeian. The nation was an incoherent mass,
war the conscription of masses, battles the waste of human
life, the brutal peace treaties the unmannered diplomacy
of the pettifogging lawyer. Yet England needed all Europe
and her own total wealth to destroy this creation of a
single man, which still lived on as an idea. At the Congress
of Vienna, the eighteenth century triumphed once
more over the Modern Age, and the term “conservative”
came in.

But it was only an apparent victory, and the result of
it was constantly in question for the rest of the century.
Metternich (whose political vision, say what one will about
his personality, penetrated further into the future than any
post-Bismarckian statesman’s) was mercilessly clear on
this point: “My private belief is that the old Europe is
at the beginning of its end. I, who am determined to go
down with it, shall know how to do my duty. The new
Europe, on the other hand, is still in the state of becoming;
between end and beginning there will be chaos.”
only to put off this chaos as long as possible.

the system of a balance of power among the great nations
arose, beginning with the Holy Alliance between Austria,
Prussia, and Russia. Treaties were concluded, alliances
sought, congresses held, to prevent any political upset of
“Europe” — which it could not have borne. When, in
spite of this, a war broke out between individual powers,
the neutrals armed at once in order to maintain the balance
at the conclusion of peace, even though minor shiftings of
frontiers had taken place — the Crimean War is a classic
example. One new formation only resulted: Germany, the
personal creation of Bismarck, became a great power, and,
what is more important, it lay in the centre of the existing
system. In this simple fact lies the germ of a tragedy which
nothing could be done to prevent. But as long as Bismarck
ruled — and he did rule in Europe, even more than at one
time Metternich — no change took place in the general
political picture. Europe kept itself to itself; no one interfered
in its affairs. The world powers were without exception
European powers. And the dread that this state of
things might come to an end — Bismarck’s cauchemar des
coalitions comes under this heading — oriented the diplomacy
of all the states concerned.

Nevertheless by 1878 the age was already ripe for the
first world war. The Russians stood before Constantinople,
England wanted to intervene, France and Austria too;
the war would at once have spread to Asia and Africa,
and perhaps America; for the threat to India from
Turkestan, the question of a protectorate for Egypt and the
Suez Canal, and Chinese problems all emerged, and be

Behind everything the beginning of the rivalry between London 
and New York showed that England’s sympathy with 
‘the Southern States in the War of Secession had not been 
forgotten. It was Bismarck’s personal supremacy alone that 
shifted the decision of the great power-problems, for which 
there was no peaceful solution, to the future — though at 
a cost. In place of real wars there was competitive arming 
for potential wars. This meant a new form of war, in 
which the parties vied with each other in the number of 
soldiers, of guns, of inventions, of the available sums of 
gold, which increased the tension almost to breaking-
point.^ And precisely at that time, though the Europe of 
Bismarck’s day remained oblivious of it, Japan, under 
Mutsuhito (1869), began to develop into a great power of 
the European brand with army, tactics, and armament-
industry; and the United States was drawing the logical 
conclusion from the Civil War of 1861-5, in which the 
settler and planter element succumbed to the coal, industry, 
bank and bourse element, and the dollar commenced 
to play a part in the world. 

From the end of the century the decay of this state 
system has become quite obvious — though not for the 
statesmen in charge, among whom there are no longer any 
outstanding figures. They all wear themselves out in the 
usual combinations, alliances, and agreements; trust to 
luck for external peace, for which standing armies present 
the security, during their term of office, and conceive of the 
future as a prolongation of the present. And over all the

cities of Europe and North America there is triumphant 
shouting over the “ progress of mankind ” as demonstrated 
by the length of railways and leading articles, the height 
of factory chimneys and Radical election figures, and 
the thickness of armour-plating and the wads of share- 
certificates in safes. The shouting drowns the thunder of 
American guns at Havana and Manila and even that of the 
new Japanese howitzers at Port Arthur, by which the little 
yellow men, spoilt and admired by foolish Europe, dem-
onstrated the precariousness of the basis on which its 
technical superiority stood and gave Russia, whose gaze 
never really left its western frontier, a most emphatic re-
minder of Asia’s existence. 

All the same, Russia had just then reason enough to 
be occupied with “ Europe.” It was clear that Austria- 
Hungary would not, or would barely, survive the death of 
the Emperor Franz Josef, and it was a question of what 
forms the new organization of these vast areas would take 
and whether war could be avoided. For not only were 
there various schemes and trends — mutually exclusive — 
in the interior of the Danubian Empire, but hopeful neigh-
bouring countries also had ideas, and beyond them again 
there were the expectations of more distant powers, who 
would welcome a conflict there as enabling them to pursue 
their own aims elsewhere. Europe’s state system, as a 
unity, was at an end and the world war, postponed in 1878, 
threatened to break out on account of the same problems 
on the same spot. And in 1912 it happened. 

Meanwhile the system began to pass into a form which

Still persists today and bears a resemblance to the Orbis 
terrarum of the Late-Hellenic and Roman centuries. In 
those days the old Greek city states, including Rome and 
Carthage, lay in the centre and all around them the “ circle 
of countries,” which furnished the armies and the money 
for their decisions.^ Macedonia, Syria, and Egypt rose 
from the heritage of Alexander the Great; Africa and 
Spain from that of Carthage; Rome had conquered North 
and South Italy, and Caesar added to these Gaul. The 
struggle as to who should control the coming Imperium, 
was fought, from Hannibal and Scipio down to the time 
of Antony and Octavian, on material supplied by the great 
border areas. And just so did relations develop in the last 
decades before 1914. A great power of the European 
order was a State which kept some hundred thousands 
of men under arms on European soil and possessed gold 
and materials enough to be able, in case of need, to mul-
tiply them tenfold in a calculable time; and behind these 
it had control of extensive border areas in other continents, 
which with their naval bases, colonial troops, and popula-
tion of raw-material producers and production-absorbers, 
formed the basis for the wealth and consequently the mili-
tary striking-force of the homeland. This was more or less 
the actual form of the British Empire, French West Africa, 
and Russian Asia, whereas in Germany the narrow out-
look of ministers and parties lost for her the opportunity 
throughout several decades of founding a great colonial 
empire in central Africa, which in wartime would have

been a power, even without being linked to the homeland, 
and would in any case have prevented a complete blockade 
by sea. The hasty endeavour to divide up the available 
remainder of the world in spheres of influence had as a 
result the gravest friction between Russia and England in 
Persia and the Gulf of Chi-li, between England and France 
at Fashoda, between England and Germany in Morocco, 
and between all these powers in China. 

Everywhere there were occasions for a great war, which 
seemed always on the point of breaking out, with a strange 
variety in the distribution of the warring parties — in the 
case of Fashoda and in the Russo-Japanese War, Russia 
and France were on the one side, England and Japan on 
the other — until at last it broke, in 1914, in a wholly 
meaningless form. It was a siege of Germany, as the “empire 
of the centre,” by the whole world; the last attempt 
on the old lines to fight out great distant problems on 
German soil, without rhyme or reason as regards object 
and site. The war would have assumed a totally different 
form, different aims, and a different ending, had it been 
possible to induce Russia to conclude a separate peace with 
Germany, for this would inevitably have brought her over 
to the side of the Central powers. In the form it took, the 
war was a foredoomed failure. Its great problems are 
today as far from solution as ever, and could never have 
been solved by alliances between such natural enemies as 
England and Russia, Japan and America. 

This war marks the end of all traditions of the grand 
diplomacy of which Bismarck was the last representative.

Not one among the deplorable later statesmen understood
his task and the historical position of his country. More
than one has since confessed to being driven, at his wits’
end and unprotesting, into the movement of events. And
so the fact that was “ Europe ” went to a stupid and undignified
death.

Who won, who was beaten? In 1918 we thought we
knew. And France at least still clings rigidly to her conviction,
because she dare not morally surrender the last
idea of her political existence as a great power, the revanche.
But how about England? Or Russia? Has Kleist’s
his short story Der Zweikampf been staged here on a world-
historical scale? Was it “Europe” that was beaten? Or
the forces of tradition? The truth is, a new form of world
has arisen, as the precondition for future crises which
must one day set in with crushing force. Russia has been
reconquered morally by Asia, and it is doubtful if the
British Empire any longer has its centre of gravity in
Europe. The rest of “ Europe ” lies now between Asia and
America — between Russia and Japan in the East and
between North America and the British Dominions in
the West — and consists substantially only of: Germany,
which is taking up her old position as a frontier against
“ Asia”; Italy, which is a power as long as Mussolini lives
and may perhaps acquire in the Mediterranean the wider
base for a true world-power; and France, who once more
considers herself lord of Europe and to whose political
system the League of Nations and the group of south-
eastern states belong. But these are all possibly, or prob-

labile, evanescent phenomena. The transformation of the
world’s political forms proceeds apace, and no one can
imagine what the maps of Asia, Africa, and even America
will look like a few decades hence.

What Metternich meant by the “chaos” that he tried to
avert from Europe as long as possible by resigned and un-
creative activity, by concentrating on preserving the exist-
ing state of things, was not so much the decay of the system
of states, with its balance of power, as the parallel decay of
the dignity of the State (Staatshoheit) even in the indi-
vidual countries, a conception which is now almost lost to
us. What we recognize as “order” today, and express in
“Liberal” constitutions, is nothing but anarchy become a
habit. We call it democracy, parliamentarism, national
self-government, but in fact it is the mere non-existence of
a conscious responsible authority, a government — that is,
a true State.

Human history in the period of the high cultures is the
history of political forces. The form of this history is war.
But peace is also part of it, for it is the continuation of
war with different means — the attempt of the vanquished
to shake off the consequences of the war in the shape of
treaties, the attempt of the victor to maintain them. A
State represents the “being in condition”^ of a national
unit trained and set up by it for real and potential wars,

WORLD WARS AND WORLD POWERS 

When the “ form ” is very high, it has in itself the value 
of a victorious war, which is won without weapons and 
solely by the weight of the force ready to come into play. 
If form is poor, it approximates to continuous defeat in the 
State’s relation to other powers. States are purely political 
units, units of radiated power. They are not units bound up 
with race, language, or religion, but stand above these. 
Whenever they coincide or mingle with such elements, their 
strength usually declines and never increases, in consequence 
of the inward contradiction. Internal politics exist 
only to secure the strength and unity of external politics, and 
when they pursue different aims of their own, decay sets 
in and the State gets “ out of form.” 

For a power to be “ in form, ” as a State among states, 
it must have the strength and unity in its leadership, its 
government, and its authority, without which the State has 
no real existence. State and government constitute the same 
form whether considered as existence or as activity. The 
powers of the eighteenth century were “ in form,” a form 
strictly defined by the dynastic tradition of court and society 
and to a great extent identical with it. The ceremonial, the 
tact of good society, the polite manners observed in bargaining 
and negotiating were but a visible expression of it. 
England, too, was in form: her island situation was a substitute 
for certain important features of a State, and parliamentary 
government was an eminently aristocratic and 
effective form, established by ancient usage, of doing business. 
France became involved in a revolution, not because 
“ the people ” opposed absolutism — which no longer ex-

existed — nor because of the poverty and indebtedness of 
the country — for these were far greater elsewhere — but 
because authority was in process of dissolution. All revo- 
lutions start from the decline of State supremacy. A street 
insurrection can never have this effect; it is a mere conse- 
quence. A modern republic is nothing but the ruin of a 
monarchy that has given itself up. 

With the nineteenth century the powers pass from the 
form of dynastic states into that of national states. But 
what, exactly, does this mean? Nations — that is, civilized 
peoples — had of course been there long before. Moreover, 
on the whole they coincided with the spheres of authority 
of the great dynasties. These nations were ideas, in the 
sense in which Goethe speaks of the idea of his existence: 
the inward form of a significant life which, unaware and 
unobserved, inspires every deed and every word. But the 
nation” in the sense of 1789 was a Rationalistic and Ro- 
mantic ideal, a wish-picture of expressly political, not to 
say social tendency. In this shallow age no one is able to 
distinguish the two. An ideal is the product of reflection, a 
conception or proposition which has to be formulated be- 
fore one can “have” it. Accordingly it shortly becomes a 
catchword which one uses without spending any more 
thought on it. Ideas, on the other hand, are wordless. Their 
vessels are seldom, if ever, aware of them, and for others 
they can hardly be conveyed in words. They must be felt 
in visualised happenings, described in actual realizations. 
Definition they defy. Neither wishes nor aims concern them. 
They are the obscure urge which attains form in a human

life and soars fatefully and directionally over the individual 
existence; thus the idea of Romanness, the idea of 
the Crusades, the Faustian idea of striving after the infinite, 
Real nations are ideas, even today. But what nationalism 
signifies, since 1789, is shown by the very fact that it confuses 
its mother-tongue with the written language of the 
city, where everyone learns to read and write — with the 
language, therefore, of newspapers and pamphlets that 
preach to all the “rights” of the nation and its pressing 
need of being delivered from this, that, or the other. Real 
nations are, like every living organism, of high internal 
structural complication and constitute a kind of order by 
their mere existence. But political Rationalism understands 
by a “nation” freedom from and struggle against any sort 
of order. “Nation” is for Rationalism analogous to mass, 

a formless, structureless thing, rulerless and aimless. This 
it calls “the sovereignty of the people.” It forgets significantly 
the matured thought and feeling of the peasantry, it 
scorns the manners and customs of true folk-life, among 
which, and in a high degree, is respect for authority. It 
knows not respect, but only principles, derived from theories, 
of which the chief is the plebeian one of “equality” 
— namely, substitution of quantity for the detested quality, 
and of number for the coveted talent. Modern nationalism 
replaces the people by the masses. It is revolutionary and 
urban through and through. 

Most sinister of all is the ideal of a nation governed 
“by itself.” A nation cannot of course govern itself any 
more than an army can lead itself — it has to be governed,

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

and as long as it possesses healthy instincts, it likes to be 
governed. But something quite different is meant: the 
notion of popular representation is from the first the leading 
principle of every such movement. Persons who designate 
themselves “representatives” of the people come along 
and recommend themselves as such. They have no inten-
tion whatever of “serving the people”; they intend to 
make the people serve them in their more or less sordid 
aims, of which the gratification of vanity is the least harm-
ful. They oppose the forces of tradition in order to set up 
themselves in its place. They oppose the State order, because 
it hampers their own form of activity. They oppose every 
kind of authority, because they wish to be responsible to 
no one, and themselves evade all responsibility. 

No constitution contains a court of appeal before which 
parties might have to justify themselves. They oppose 
above all the cultured form of the State, which has slowly 
grown up and matured, because they do not possess it within 
themselves as the good society of the eighteenth century 
possessed it, and therefore feel it as a form of compulsion 
— which it is not for culture-people. Thus we get the “democ-
racy” of the century — not form, but formlessness in 
every sense as a principle — parliamentarianism — consti-
tutional anarchy — the republic — the negation of every 
kind of authority. 

And so European states got “out of form” in propor-
tion as they were more “progressively” governed. This 
was the chaos which moved Metternich to oppose democracy 
irrespective of its tendency, in the Romantic type of the 

E383 

WORLD WARS AND WORLD POWERS 

Wars of Liberation as well as the Rationalistic type of the 
Bastille-stormers — both of which were combined in 1848 
— and to be equally conservative in his attitude towards 
all reforms. Since then parties have been formed in all 
countries; that is, side by side with individual idealists 
there arose groups of business politicians of doubtful ori-
gin and more than doubtful ethics: journalists, advocates, 
financiers, literary hacks, party agents. They governed by 
representing their own interests. Monarchs and ministers 
had invariably been responsible to someone, if only to 
public opinion. These groups alone were accountable to 
nobody. The press, originally the organ of public opinion, 
had long since begun to serve the man who subsidized it; 
elections, once the expression of that opinion, brought in as 
victorious the party with the biggest money behind it. If 
nevertheless there still existed a kind of State order, or 
conscientious ruling or authority, it resided in remnants of 
the eighteenth-century form, which persisted in the form 
of monarchy, however constitutional, of the officer-corps, 
of diplomatic tradition; and as regards England, in age-old 
parliamentary usage (particularly in the Upper House) 
and in the two-party system. To these remnants was due 
everything that the State succeeded in bringing about in 
spite of parliaments. Had Bismarck not been able to rely 
upon his king, he would promptly have succumbed to the 
democracy. Political dilettantism, whose arena was parlia-
ment, regarded these forces of tradition with suspicion and 
hatred. It opposed them on principle and without restraint 
or thought for the external consequences. And thus, every-

where, home politics became a sphere which made demands 
on experienced statesmen that were quite out of relation to 
its importance, wasting their time and strength, and causing 
them to forget — and to will to forget — the original meaning 
of statesmanship, which is the direction of external 
policy. This condition of things is the anarchic intermezzo 
known today as democracy, which leads from the destruction 
of monarchical State supremacy by way of political, 
plebeian Rationalism to the Caesarism of the future. There 
are already signs, in the dictatorial tendencies of our time, 
of this Caesarism, which is destined to assume the unlimited 
mastery over the ruins of historical tradition.

Among the gravest signs of the decay of State authority is 
the fact that in the course of the nineteenth century economics 
came to be considered more important than politics. 
Few of those who are at all in touch with present-day decisions 
will deny this with any conviction. Not only is 
political power regarded as an element in public life whose 
first, if not sole, task it is to serve the nation’s economics — 
it is also expected to conform entirely to the desires and 
views of this economics and, in a word, to be at the disposal 
of the economic leaders. This is now the situation, far 
and wide, and the consequences may be read in the history 
of our time. 

Actually, politics and economics cannot be separated in 
the life of a nation, for they are (as must be repeated again 
and again) two sides of the same life. But they stand to


--- Página 43 ---

401 

WORLD WARS AND WORLD POWERS 

each other in the capacity of the navigation of a vessel and 
the destination of its freight. On board, it is the captain, 
not the merchant whose goods are carried, who has priority. 
If the impression prevails today that economic leadership 
is the more powerful element, this is because political 
leadership has degenerated into partisan anarchy and 
hardly deserves the name of leadership at all, so that by 
contrast the economic leadership appears to tower above 
it. But when one house is left standing amid the ruins after 
an earthquake, it is not necessarily the most important one. 
In history, when it is moving on “ in good form ” and is not 
tumultuous or revolutionary, the economic leader has never 
been the one to make decisions. He adapts himself to the 
political considerations and serves them with the means 
that are in his hands. Without a strong policy there has 
never and nowhere been a healthy economic system, although 
materialistic theories teach the contrary. Adam 
Smith, the founder of political economy, treated economic 
existence as the true human life, money-making as the 
meaning of history, and was wont to describe statesmen as 
dangerous animals; yet this very England became what it 
became — the foremost country, economically speaking, in 
the world — owing, not to the merchants and factory-owners, 
but to genuine politicians like the two Pitts, whose grandiose 
foreign policy was carried through often in the teeth 
of violent opposition from the short-sighted economists. 
They were pure statesmen, too, who carried on the struggle 
against Napoleon up to the verge of a financial crash, because 
they saw further ahead than the balancing of next

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

year’s budget — the normal limit of our political horizon 
today. But as things are now, the inadequacy of our leading 
statesmen, who themselves for the most part have interests in private 
concerns, allows business to intervene 
authoritatively in important decisions. However, it is business in its widest 
implication: not only banks and firms, 
with or without party protection, but also the concerns dealing 
with the raising of wages and the shortening of hours 
which call themselves Labour parties. The last is the logical 
result of the first, and therein lies the tragic side of every 
economic system which tries to be its own political security. 
This again was first seen in 1789, among the Girondists, 
who tried to make the business interests of the well-to-do 
bourgeoisie the justification for the existence of State powers, 
and later, under Louis Philippe, the bourgeois king, 
this was to a great extent realized. The notorious motto: 
“Enrichissez-vous” entered into political morals. It was 
only too well understood and obeyed, and that not only by 
trade and commerce and the politicians themselves, but also 
by the wage-earning class, which at that time (1848) likewise 
took advantage of the decline of State authority for 
their own ends. And now the economic tendency became 
uppermost in the stealthy form of revolution typical of the 
century, which is called democracy and demonstrates itself 
periodically, in revolts by ballot or barricade on the part 
of the masses, and by the upsetting of cabinets and voting 
down the budget on the part of the people’s representatives. 
This was the case in England, where the Free Trade doctrine 
of the Manchester school was applied by the trade unions

to the form of goods called “ labour ” and eventually received 
theoretical formulation in the “ Communist Manifesto ” 
of Marx and Engels. And so was completed the dethronement 
of politics by economics, of the State by the counting-house, 
of the diplomatist by the trade-union leader; and it is here 
and not in the sequelae of the World War that the seeds of 
the present economic crisis will be found. This whole crushing 
depression is purely and simply the result of the decline of 
State powers 

Yet the century might have taken warning by historical 
experience. No economic enterprises have ever really attained 
their end without the support of a politically ambitious 
government. It is quite wrong to speak of the “ raids ” of 
the Vikings, with whom the command of the sea began for 
the Western world. Obviously they were out for booty — 
whether in form of land, men, or treasure was another question 
— but the Viking ship was a State in itself, and the plan, 
the high command, and the tactics of the voyage were pure 
policy. When the ship grew into a fleet, states were founded 
on the strength of it — and with a most pronounced authority 
behind them too, as in Normandy, England, and Sicily. The 
German Hansa would have remained an economic great power 
had Germany itself become a political one. It was when this 
mighty federation of cities came to an end — it occurred to 
no one to regard its protection as a duty of the German State 
— that Germany fell out of the great world economic combinations 
of the West. Only in the nineteenth century did it find its way 
back, and then not through private enterprise, but solely through

Bismarck’s political achievements, which inspired the imperialistic
advance of the German economic system.

Maritime imperialism, the expression of the Faustian
striving towards infinity, began to assume large forms from
the time when the economic outlet in the direction of Asia
was politically barred by the Turkish conquest of Constantinople
in 1453. This was the deeper motive for the discovery of the oversea
trade route to the East Indies by the Portuguese and the discovery
of America by the Spaniards — with the great powers of the period
behind them. The dominant motives, in individuals, were no doubt
ambition, love of adventure, delight in battle and danger, thirst for
gold — certainly not mere “good business.” The discovered
countries were to be conquered and ruled over; they were to strengthen
the power of the Habsburgs in European combinations. The vision
of an empire over which the sun never set was a political vision,
the consequence of superior statesmanship and only as such a field
for economic reward. It was the same when England won the primacy
— not through her economic strength (which did not at first exist),
but through the wise regimen of the nobility, Tory and Whig alike.
England gained her wealth by battles and not by bookkeeping and
speculation. That is why the English people, for all its “Liberal”
thinking and talking, remained in practice the most conservative
in Europe; conservative, that is, in the sense of preserving all past
forms of power even to the smallest ceremonial details, for all that
they might smile or laugh outright at them. So long as no more
powerful new form was in sight, so long were all the

old ones retained: the two-party system, the Government’s 
way of detaching itself from Parliament when making 
decisions, the House of Lords and the monarchy as braking 
elements in critical situations. This instinct has saved 
England time upon time, and if it should now die out, it will 
mean the loss, not only of political, but of economic position 
in the world. Neither Mirabeau, Talleyrand, Metternich, 
nor Wellington understood anything about economics. 
Undoubtedly they found pretexts in it — but how much worse 
if, in their place, an economic expert had tried to dictate 
politics! Once imperialism falls into the hands of economic 
and materialistic business men and ceases to be high policy, 
it very quickly sinks from the level of the interests of the 
economic governing class to that of the class war of the 
actual workers, and thus the great economic systems 
become disintegrated — and pull down the great powers with 
them into the abyss.

Of all expressions of the “national” revolutions that have 
happened since 1789 the most fertile in consequences was 
the nineteenth-century standing army. The professional 
armies of dynastic states were replaced by mass armies 
formed on the basis of universal conscription. This was, 
fundamentally, a Jacobin ideal. The levee en masse of 1792 
expressed the nation as mass, which was meant to be 
organized on a basis of perfect equality, in contrast to the old 
nation of steady growth and class ordering. But the Rights 
of Man enthusiasts soon made the discovery that the wild 
onsets of these uniformed masses produced something quite

unexpected: a glorious, barbaric, and quite untheoretical 
joy in danger, mastery, and victory. It was the relic of 
healthy race-instinct, the trace of Nordic heroism left in 
these nations. Blood was once more stronger than mind. 
The theoretical enthusiasm for the ideal of a nation in arms 
had had a quite other, more conscious, more Rationalistic 
aim than the discharge of these elementary impulses, as in 
Germany, where during — and especially after — the 
Wars of Liberation, which led up to the revolutions of 1830 
and 1848, these armies, “in which there was no distinction 
between high and low, rich and poor,” were conceived of as 
furnishing the model for a future nation in which all differences 
of rank, possessions, and ability were in some way 
to be removed. This was the secret thought of many of the 
volunteers of 1813, but equally that of literary “Young 
Germany” — Heine, Herwegh, Freiligrath — and many 
men of the Paulskirche,^ as, for instance, Uhland. The principle 
of inorganic equality was for them crucial. Men of 
the stamp of Jahn and Arndt had no notion that it was 
Equality that had first sounded the cry of “Vive la nation” 
in the September massacres of 1792. 

They forgot, too, one basic fact. The Romanticism of 
their Volkslieder sang only the heroism of the common 
soldier, but the inner worth of these armies (at first amateurs 
in the calling of arms), their spirit, their discipline, 
and their training, depended upon the quality of the officer-corps, 
whose adequacy was due entirely to eighteenth- 
century traditions. With the Jacobins also a body of soldiers

was morally worth precisely as much as its officer, who had 
trained it by his example. Napoleon confessed at St. Helena 
that he would not have been beaten had he had for his 
superb fighting material a corps of officers like the Austrian, 
a corps in which chivalrous traditions of loyalty, honour, 
and silent self-discipline still survived. Once the command 
wavers in its intentions and its attitude — or itself abdicates, 
as in 1918 — the bravest regiment becomes on the 
spot a cowardly and helpless herd. 

Given the rapid disintegration of the forms of power in 
Europe, it was a wonder that this means of power held out 
against it. Yet in fact it did so. The great armies were the 
most conservative element of the nineteenth century. It was 
they and not the debilitated monarchy, the nobility, or even 
the church that upheld the form of State authority and enabled 
it to cope with the anarchic tendencies of Liberalism. 
“What will come out of all this ruin,” wrote Metternich ^ 
in 1849, “no one today can tell. An element of force has 
arisen, not only in Austria, but in the whole of hard-pressed 
Europe. This element is called: standing armies. Unfortunately 
it is only a conserving, not a creative element, and it 
is creativeness that is wanted.” And, indeed, it was wholly 
on the strict ideals of the officer-corps — to the level of 
which the rank and file had been trained — that all depended. 
In the local riots and insurrections that happened 
in 1848 and later, the responsibility of failure was always 
traceable to moral inferiority in the officers. Would-be

political generals who considered themselves entitled by 
their military rank to make statesmanlike decisions and act 
according to them have always existed — in Spain and 
France as in Prussia and Austria — but the officer-corps as 
a whole always declined to hold political opinions of its 
own. In 1830, 1848, 1870, it was the armies that stood 
firm, not the crowns. 

It was the armies, also, which averted war from 1870 
onward, for no one dared to set this mighty force in motion 
for fear of its incalculable effect. Hence the abnormal state 
of peace between 1870 and 1914, which renders it almost 
impossible for us to see how things really lay.^ In the place 
of direct wars we have the indirect variety, in the form of 
a steady increase of war-preparedness, of the pace of armament 
and technical invention: a war in which there are 
similarly victories, defeats, and shortlived peace treaties.^ 
But this method of disguised warfare presupposes a national 
wealth such as only countries with an extensive 
industrial system have amassed — to a great extent the 
wealth, in so far as it represented capital, actually consisted 
in the industrial system — and the existence of the system 
presupposed supplies of coal, on which all industries depended.^ 
Money is needed to wage war, and still more 
money for war preparations. Industrialism therefore became 
in itself a weapon. The more productive it was, the 
more certainly could its success be gauged in advance.

Every furnace, every machine-factory increased war-preparedness.
The prospect of successful operations became
more and more dependent upon the possibility of unlimited
consumption of material — above all, munitions. Only
gradually did this fact grow familiar. In the peace negotiations
of 1871 Bismarck still laid all the stress on strategic
points like Metz and Belfort, and none at all on the Lorraine
mining area. But once the whole relation between economics
and war, between coal and cannon, was realized, a revulsion
set in: a strong economic system came to be regarded as the
all-important premiss for war; it was now the first consideration,
and at once the cannon began to be used to obtain
coal.^ The decline of the State as a concept in consequence
of all-grasping parliamentarism soon followed. The eco-
nomic system — from trust to trade union — began to play
its part in governing and in influencing the aims and meth-
ods of foreign policy by its vote. Colonial and oversea pol-
icy became a struggle for the marketing areas and raw-
material sources of industry, and among these sources oil
became more and more important. For petroleum was be-
ginning to threaten — nay, to oust — coal. Without the oil
motor, automobiles, airplanes, and submarines would have
been impossible.

The same tendency was seen in preparation for sea war-
fare.^ When the American Civil War began, armed mer-
chantmen were practically on a level with the contemporary
warships. Three years later, armoured vessels were the

sea-ruling type. Out of these ships evolved, at a feverish 
pace of construction, ever larger and more powerful types, 
of which each in turn became out of date in a few years. 
These were the floating fortresses of the turn of the century, 
monstrous machines which on account of their coal requirements 
became ever more dependent upon coastal bases. The 
old rivalry for supremacy between sea and land began in 
a certain sense to incline landwards. Whoever had the naval 
bases, with their docks and reserves of material, ruled the 
sea irrespective of the size of the fleet. “Rule Britannia” 
depended in the last resort upon England’s wealth of colonies, 
which were there for the sake of the ships and not 
vice versa. Therein lay the importance of Gibraltar, Malta, 
Aden, Singapore, the Bermudas, and numerous other strategic 
bases. The meaning of the war, the decisive battle at 
sea, was lost sight of. The enemy fleet was shut off from the 
coast by way of rendering it helpless. There was never anything 
at sea corresponding to the operations plan of a general 
staff, never a decision fought out to the end by these 
battle squadrons. The theoretical dispute on the value of 
Dreadnoughts after the Russo-Japanese War was due to 
the fact that Japan had built the type, but had not yet 
tested it. In the World War, too, the battleships lay quiet in 
the harbours. They might as well not have existed. Even 
the battle of Skagerrak (Jutland) was only a surprise, the 
offer of a battle, which the English fleet evaded as well as 
it could. Few indeed of the great ships that have been put 
out of service within the last fifty years as obsolete have 
fired a shot at an enemy of equal standing. And the devel-

Development of the air arm today makes it doubtful whether the
day of armoured ships is not altogether past. The Corsair
warfare may perhaps be the only thing left.

“In the course of the World War a complete transformation
took place on land. The national mass-armies, which
had been developed to the extreme limit of their possibilities
and constituted a weapon that, in contrast to the battle
fleet, was really “used up,” ended in the trenches, where
the siege of Germany was carried on by assaults and sorties
until the capitulation. Quantity triumphed over quality,
mechanism over life. The great numbers put an end to the
type of mobility that Napoleon had introduced into tactics,
particularly in the campaign of 1805 which led in a few
weeks through Ulm to Austerlitz, and that the Americans
had enhanced in 1861-5 by the use of railways. The World
War, too, would have been impossible both as to form and
as to duration without the railways, which enabled Germany
to shift whole armies between East and West.

Two really great revolutions in the conduct of war in
world history have been brought about by a sudden increase
in mobility: the one was in the first centuries after 1000 B.C.,
when at some point in the wide plains between the Danube
and the Amur the saddle-horse made its appearance.
Mounted armies were far superior to foot-soldiers.^ They

^ As well as to war chariots, which were used only in the battle and not
on the march. They came in about a thousand years earlier in the same
region and proved, wherever they appeared, to be immensely superior to
the existing mode of fighting in the field. They were adopted in China and
India from about 1500, in the Near East somewhat earlier, and in the
Hellenic world from about 1600 B.C. They soon came into general use, but
disappeared when cavalry (even though as auxiliary to infantry) became a
permanent arm.

could appear and vanish again without offering the enemy 
any chance of attacking or pursuing them. In vain did the 
nations, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, set up mounted 
troops alongside their infantry, for the latter hampered the 
freedom of movement of the horse. Equally vain was the 
encircling of the Roman, and of the Chinese, Imperium with 
walls and ditches. (The Chinese Wall still runs across half 
of Asia, and the Roman Limes in the Syrian-Arabian desert 
has just been discovered.) It was not possible to assemble 
the armies behind these walls with the speed demanded by 
surprise attacks, and the Chinese, Indian, Roman, Arabian, 
and Western worlds, with their settled peasant populations, 
succumbed again and again in helpless terror to the Parthians, 
Huns, Scythians, Mongols, and Turks. It is as if 
peasantry and life in the saddle were spiritually irreconcilable. 
It was still superior speed that gave victory to the 
hordes of Genghis Khan. 

The second transformation we are experiencing in our 
own time — the replacing of the horse by the “horse-power” 
of Faustian technics. Right up to the first world 
war it was precisely the old and famous cavalry regiments 
of Western Europe which, more than any other arm, were 
haloed with the pride of chivalry and adventurousness and 
heroism. For centuries they were true Vikings of the land. 
More and more they came to stand for the genuine vocation 
and life of the soldier, in a far higher degree than the infantry 
of universal service. In the future it will be different. 
Aircraft and tank squadrons are taking their place. Mobility 
will be thereby intensified from the limit of organic

possibilities to the inorganic possibilities of the machine — 
but, as it were, of the individual machine — which, however, 
unlike the impersonal drum-fire of the trenches, presents 
grand openings for personal heroism. 

More significant even than this critical decision between 
mass and mobility, another factor intervenes in the fate of 
standing armies which will inevitably prove fatal to the 
nineteenth-century principle of universal national conscription. 
The decline of authority, the substitution of party for 
State — in a word, progressive anarchy — had up till 1914 
stopped short of the army. So long as there remained an 
officer-corps to train a rapidly changing body of men, there 
remained also the ethical value of military honour, fidelity, 
and silent obedience, the spirit of Frederick the Great, Napoleon, 
Wellington — that is, the eighteenth century — 
and the chivalresque attitude to life. This great element of 
stability was first shaken in the war of positions, when 
hastily-trained young officers were set to deal with older 
troops which had years of war service. Here, again, the 
long peace of 1870 to 1914 suspended a development which 
was bound to accompany the progressive decline in the 
“form” of the nations. The ranks, including the lower 
grades of the officer-corps (who saw the world from below, 
because they were leaders not by profession but to meet a 
passing need), came to have their own view of political 
possibilities. This view was, needless to say, imported from 
outside, either from the enemy or through the propaganda 
and disintegration “cells” of the Radical parties in their 
own countries, and with this view came the impulse to think

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

out ways of imposing it. Thus did the element of anarchy 
enter the army, the one institution which had so far baffled 
it. And after the War it continued its work in all the barracks 
of peace-time standing armies. Moreover the plain 
man of the people had, like the professional politician and 
the Radical leader, for forty years dreaded and exaggerated 
the unknown effect which modern armies would have, upon 
both foreign armies and insurgents, and therefore hardly 
even considered the possibility of resisting them.^ The 
Social-Democrats had given up the idea of a revolution 
long before the War — it was merely a phrase in their program 
— and one company was sufficient to hold thousands 
of excited civilians in check. But the War proved how negligible 
the effect even of a strong force with heavy artillery 
can be upon our stone-built cities, when there is house-to-house 
defence. The regular army lost its nimbus of invincibility 
vis-à-vis revolutions. Nowadays a conscript has 
a very different idea about it all from that which he had 
before the War. As a result he has lost the consciousness of 
being a mere object of the commanding force. I am very 
doubtful whether, for instance, in France a general mobilization 
against a dangerous enemy could be carried out at all. 
What is to happen if the masses refuse to be conscripted? 
And what is the value of such troops, when one does not 
know how far their moral disintegration has gone or on 
what fraction of the men one can really rely? This is the 
end of that universal conscription which in 1792 had the 
impetus of national war-enthusiasm behind it and started 
^ Politische Schriften pp. 179 et seq.

WORLD WARS AND WORLD POWERS 

with voluntary armies of professional soldiers, who 
swarmed round some popular leader or were fired by some 
great aim. In all the Cultures — consider, for instance, the 
substitution of paid professional armies for the conscripted 
Roman peasant armies after Marius, and the consequences 
— this has been the way to Caesarism and is at bottom the 
instinctive revolt of the blood, of the reserve of race-instinct, 
of the primitive will-to-power, against the material forces 
of money and intellect, anarchist theories, and the speculation 
which exploits them — the way from democracy to 
plutocracy. 

These materialistic and plebeian forces have since the 
end of the eighteenth century proceeded quite logically to 
adopt other means of fighting that were closer to their 
modes of thought and experience. Side by side with armies 
and navies, used to an increasing extent for purposes remote 
from the nations themselves and serving solely the 
business aims of individual groups — the name “Opium 
War” is a drastic comment on this — there arose methods 
of economic warfare, which often enough led in “peace” 
time to battles, victories, and peace treaties that were purely 
economic. Real soldiers, like Moltke, let us say, scorned 
these methods and undoubtedly underestimated their effect. 
All the more did they appeal to “modern” statesmen who, 
in consequence of their upbringing and disposition, thought 
first in terms of economics and only then (and perhaps) 
politically. The growing dissolution of State authority

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

through parliamentarism afforded the opportunity to exploit 
the organs of governmental power in this direction. 
Above all, in England, which by the middle of the nineteenth 
century had become a “nation of shopkeepers,” an 
enemy power was not to be overthrown by military, but 
ruined by economic rivalry, and at the same time retained 
as a purchaser of English goods. That has been the intention 
of free-trade “Liberal” imperialism since Robert Peel. 
Napoleon conceived of the Continental blockade as a purely 
military measure because he had no other available against 
England. On the Continent he created only new dynasties, 
whereas Pitt founded trading and plantation colonies in 
distant lands. The war of 1914, however, was fought by 
England, not on France’s behalf nor on Belgium’s, but for 
the sake of the “week-end,” to dispose of Germany, if possible, 
for good, as an economic rival. In 1916 there set in, 
side by side with the military war, a systematic economic 
war, to be carried on when the other came inevitably to an 
end, and from then onward the war aims were oriented 
more and more in that direction. The Treaty of Versailles 
was not intended to create a state of peace but to organize 
the relation of forces in such a way that this aim could at 
any time be secured by fresh demands and measures. Hence 
the handing over of the colonies and the merchant fleet, the 
seizure of bank bonds, property, and patents in all countries, 
the severance of industrial areas like Upper Silesia 
and the Saar valley, the inauguration of the Republic — by 
which it was expected (and correctly) that industry would 
be undermined by the power assumed by trade unions —

and finally the reparations, which England, at least, intended not as war indemnification but as a permanent burden on German industry until it should collapse. 

But with this there set in, quite contrary to the expectation of the powers which had dictated the treaty, a new economic war, in which we are still engaged and which accounts for a very considerable part of the present “world economic crisis.” The distribution of power in the world had been completely changed by the strengthening of the United States and its high finance and by the new form of the Russian Empire. The opponents and the methods were changed. The present-day war with economic weapons (which may later be accounted a second world war) produced wholly new forms in the Bolshevik economic offensive expressed in the Five Year Plan; the attack by dollars and francs on the pound sterling; the inflations engineered by foreign exchanges which destroyed the whole contents of national exchequers; autarchy of economic systems which may be carried to the extent of wiping out exports from the opposing powers and therewith the whole economic system and the means of existence for great nations; and the Dawes and Young plans, which represent the attempts of financial groups to force whole states to do forced labour for the banks. What it really amounts to is that the life of one’s own nation has to be gained at the cost of destroying that of others. It is the struggle on the keel of the overturned boat. And when all other means are exhausted, then the oldest and most primitive, the military means, will come into their own again. The more strongly

armed power will force the weaker one to give up its economic 
defensive, capitulate, and disappear. Cannons are in 
the last resort stronger than coal. There is no telling how 
this economic war will end, but it is certain that it will 
finally restore to the State as authority its historical rights, 
based on voluntary, and therefore reliable, thoroughly 
trained, and highly mobile armies — and will push back 
economics to the second place, where they belong. 

& 

In this age of transition, of formlessness “ between the 
ages,” which is probably still far short of the summit of 
confusion and passing forms, new tendencies pointing towards 
the distant future are faintly outlining themselves. 
The powers which are destined to wage the final war for 
supremacy on this planet are beginning to shape themselves 
into form and position; only one of them can give the 
Imperium mundi its name, and that provided that no terrible 
fate destroys it before completion. Nations of a new 
order are about to arise which are not as those of today, 
summations of individuals of equal rank and of like speech, 
nor as those of yesterday, when, as in the Renaissance, one 
recognized with an assurance that rested on the style, the 
soul of it, a painting, a battle, a face, an idea, a form of 
moral outlook and opinion as Italian — although there was 
as yet no Italian State in existence. The Faustian nations of 
the end of the twentieth century will be elective affinities 
of men with a common feeling about life, with the same 
imperatives of a strong will and naturally with the same

language, but without their knowledge of that language 
constituting either a hall-mark or a limitation. They will 
be men of race — not in the sense of today’s belief in race, 
but in my sense of it as a matter of strong instincts, among 
them that superior eye for the things of reality that the 
cosmopolitans and authors today can no longer distinguish 
from the flash of mere intelligence; in short, men who feel 
themselves born and called to be masters. What matters 
number? It only tyrannized over the last century, which 
bowed the knee to quantity. A man means a great deal as 
opposed to a mass of slavish souls, pacifists and world- 
improvers who yearn for quiet at any cost, even that of 
“liberty.” It is the transition from the populus Romanus 
of the time of Hannibal to the representatives of Romanness 
in the first century, who in part, witness Marius and Cicero, 
were not “Romans” at all. 

It seems as if Western Europe had lost its authoritative 
significance, but, except as regards politics, this is only apparently so. The idea of the Faustian civilization grew up 
here. Here are its roots, and here it will win the final victory 
in its history or swiftly perish. Decisions, wherever made, 
are made on account of the Western world, though not for 
its money or happiness, but for its soul’s sake. But at present 
the power has been transferred to the border areas of 
Asia and America. In the one the power spreads over the 
largest inland mass of the globe; in the other — the United 
States and the British Dominions — over the two world- 
historical oceans connected by the Panama Canal. Yet none 
of the world powers of today stands so firmly that one can

Say with certainty that it will still be a power in a hundred
or in fifty years, or even exist at all.

What is a power in the grand style today? A state, or
state-like structure, with a government which has world-
political aims and probably also the power to enforce them
by whatever means it relies upon — armies, navies, political
organization, credits, mighty banking or industrial
groups with the same interests, and lastly and above all a
strong strategic position on the globe. We may name them
all after the million-cities in which power and the spirit of
that power are garnered. Compared with them, whole countries
and peoples are no more than “the provinces.” ^
First of all there is “Moscow,” mysterious and to Western
thought and feeling quite incalculable, the decisive
factor for Europe since 1812 (when it still belonged to it
as a State), but since 1917 for the whole world. The triumph
of the Bolsheviks signifies historically something
quite other than political socialism or theoretical economics.
Asia has regained Russia, which “Europe” in the
shape of Peter the Great had annexed. The conception
“Europe” therefore disappears again from practical political
thought — or ought to do so if we had any outstanding
statesmen. But this “Asia” is an Idea, and an idea with
a future too. Race, language, popular customs, religion, in
their present form, are a matter of comparative indifference.
All or any of them can and will be fundamentally
transformed. What we see today, then, is simply the new
kind of life which a vast land has conceived and will pres-

gently bring forth. It is not definable in words, neither is its
bearer aware of it. Those who attempt to define, establish,
lay down a program for the future are confusing life with
a phrase, as does the ruling Bolshevism, which is not sufficiently
conscious of its own West-European, Rationalistic,
and cosmopolitan origin.

The population of this mightiest of the earth’s inland
areas is unassailable from outside. Distance is a force politically
and militarily, which has not yet been conquered.
Napoleon came to know this. What good does it do the
enemy to occupy areas no matter how immense? To make
even the attempt impossible the Bolsheviks have transferred
the centre of gravity of their system farther and farther
eastward. The great industrial areas which are important
to power-politics have one and all been built up east of
Moscow, for the greater part east of the Urals as far as the
Altai and on the south down to the Caucasus. The whole
area west of Moscow — White Russia, the Ukraine, once
from Riga to Odessa the most vital portion of the Tsar’s
Empire forms today a fantastic glacis against “Europe.”
It could be sacrificed without a crash of the whole
system. But by the same token any idea of an offensive
from the West has become senseless. It would be a thrust
into empty space.

This Bolshevik rule is not a State in our sense of the
word, as Petrine Russia was. It consists — like Kipchak
the Empire of the “Golden Horde” in the Mongolian
period — of a ruling horde, called the Communist Party,
with its chieftains and almighty Khan and a downtrodden,

defenceless mass of people some hundred times as large. 
Of genuine Marxism there is very little except in names 
and programs. Actually there is a Tartar-like absolutism, 
which disturbs and exploits the world regardless of any 
limits save those of caution, grim, cruel, with murder as a 
routine administrative method, constantly in presence of 
the possibility of a Genghis Khan rising to roll up Asia and 
Europe. 

The real Russian has remained nomadic in his life-feeling, just as the northern Chinese, Manchu, and Turcoman have done.^ His home is not the village, but the endless 
plain, Little Mother Russia. The soul of this endless landscape 
drives him to wander without a goal. The “will” is 
lacking. The Germanic life-feeling has a goal to be won, 
whether this be a distant land, the solution of a problem, a 
God, power, fame, or riches, but here peasant families, 
mechanics, and labourers wander from one neighbourhood 
to another, from factory to factory, not of necessity, but 
driven by a hidden urge. No repressive measure of the 
Soviets has succeeded in stopping this, although it makes 
impossible the founding of a stock of trained workers 
bound up with their work — a fact that of itself foredooms 
to failure the attempt to build up and maintain an economic 
system on West-European lines. 

But is the Communist program really still taken seri-
ously — that is, as an ideal to which millions of human 
beings have been sacrificed and for the sake of which mil-
lions more are condemned to starvation and poverty? Or is

is just an extremely effective means of defence against the 
downtrodden masses — above all, the peasants — and of 
attack against the hated non-Russian world, which is to be 
disintegrated before it is overthrown.¹ Obviously there 
would be no startling change if, one day, the Communist 
principle were dropped in deference to the requirements 
of power-policy. Names would be altered: the administrative 
branch of the economic system would be called 
“firms,” commissions “control boards,” and the Communists 
themselves “shareholders,” and for that matter 
the form of Western capitalism has found its way in long 
ago. 

But this power can conduct no foreign wars, either to 
West or to East, otherwise than by propaganda. The system 
is far too artificial, for it still has the West-European 
Rationalistic features inherited from the literary underworld 
of Petersburg. It would not survive a defeat, since it 
could not even survive a victory; the Moscow bureaucracy, 
if confronted with a victorious general, would be lost and 
Soviet Russia would be succeeded by some other Russia, 
the ruling horde being probably massacred. But this would 
mean only the overthrow of the Marxian type of Bolshevism, 
whereas the nationalist-Asiatic type would reach 
gigantic proportions unchecked. Is the Red Army really 
reliable, and employable? And has the officer-corps the 
requisite professional and moral qualities? What is shown 
in the Moscow parades is simply the picked regiments of

reliable Communists, the actual bodyguard of those in authority, 
and from the provinces we hear only of suppressed 
conspiracies. And are the railways, aircraft, and munitioning 
industries capable of standing a really serious test? 
The Russian attitude in Manchuria and the non-aggression 
pacts in the West certainly disclose a determination to 
avoid a military test in any circumstances. Those other 
means, economic annihilation of the enemy and, above all, 
revolution — not as an ideal aim, but as a weapon, as England 
and France used it against Germany in 1918 — are 
less dangerous and more effective. 

Japan, on the contrary, holds a very strong position. She 
is almost unassailable by sea owing to her conformation as 
a chain of islands, the narrow channels between which can 
be securely barred by minefields, submarines, and aircraft, 
so as to put the China Sea out of reach of any foreign fleet. 
Further, she has secured in Manchuria a slice of the mainland 
which will be of enormous importance economically 
(the soya-bean has already destroyed the lucrative value 
of the coconut and oil palms in the South Seas and West 
Africa) and whose population grows at an incredible 
rate,* while its definitive boundaries have not yet been fixed. 
The least attempt by the Bolsheviks to take military measures 
against this shifting of power would lead to the taking 
of Vladivostok, Eastern Mongolia, and probably Peking. 

The only practical counteracting influence is the Red Revolution 
in China, but since the founding of the Kuomintang

thirty million.

this has come to grief again and again through “capitalist” 
attacks — namely, the buying-off of generals and whole 
armies from one side or another. Immemorially old “Fellaheen” peoples ^ such as the Indian and Chinese can 
never again play an independent part in the world of the 
great powers. They can change their masters, drive one 
out — as, for example, the Englishman from India — but 
it is only to succumb to another. They will never again produce 
a form of political existence of their own. For that 
they are too old, too rigid, too used up. Even the form of 
their present rebelliousness, together with its aims — liberty, 
equality, parliament, republic, Communism, and the 
like — is without exception imported from Western Europe 
and Moscow. They constitute objects and war resources 
for foreign powers, their countries are battlefields 
for the decisive battles of foreigners, though precisely for 
that reason they may achieve immense, if transitory, 
importance. 

Russia and Japan undoubtedly have their eyes fixed on 
the potential uses of these peoples and are working in 
secret by methods which the “Whites” neither know nor 
see. But does Japan really stand as firm today as at the 
time of the war with Russia? Then there reigned the old, 
proud, honourable, and courageous ruling class of the 
Samurai, one of the best examples of “race” that the 
world has known. Today, one hears of Radicals, 
strikes, Bolshevist propaganda, and murdered ministers.

existence, poisoned by the Democratic and Marxian decay-forms
of the White nations — and this at the moment when
the struggle for the Pacific is entering on its decisive phase?
If it still possesses its old offensive power, then, given its
incomparable strategic position on the sea, it can deal with
any enemy combination. But who can seriously be considered
as an enemy here? Certainly not Russia, and
equally no West-European power. Nowhere can the decline
of all these states from their former political status be so
clearly gauged as in this connexion. Not much more than
twenty years ago Port Arthur, Wei-Hai-Wai and Kiao-chau
were “occupied” and the partition of China into the
spheres of interest for the Western powers was in full swing.
Once the Pacific problem was a European one. Now not
even England ventures to carry out the development of
Singapore which was planned several decades ago. It was
to have been the mighty base for the British navy in time
of Asiatic complications, but the question is now: could it
be held against Japan and France, once the latter can use
the overland route through Hither India? On the other
hand, if England retires from her former position in these
seas, thereby exposing Australia to the Japanese pressure,
that continent will certainly leave the Empire and attach
itself to America. America is the only serious opponent,
but how strong is even she at this point on the water, notwithstanding
the Panama Canal? San Francisco and
Hawaii lie much too far apart to serve as naval bases
against Japan; the Philippines can scarcely be held, and
Japan has potential allies against New York in Latin

Is the United States a power with a future? Before 1914 
superficial observers talked of unlimited possibilities after 
they had looked about them for a week or two, and post-war 
“society” from Western Europe, compounded of snobs 
and mobs, was full of enthusiasm for “husky” young 
America as being far superior to ourselves — nay, 
positively a model for us to follow. But for purposes of durable 
form records and dollars must not be taken to represent the 
spiritual strength and depth of the people to whom they 
belong; neither must sport be confused with race-soundness 
nor business intelligence with spirit and mind. What is 
“hundred per cent Americanism”? A mass existence 
standardized to a low average level, a primitive pose, or a 
promise for the future? 

All we know is that so far there is neither a real nation 
nor a real State. Can both of these develop out of the knocks 
of fate, or is this possibility excluded by the very fact of 
the Colonial type, whose spiritual past belongs elsewhere 
and is now dead? The American does not talk of State or 
Mother Country like the Englishman, but of “this country.” 
Actually what it amounts to is a boundless field and a popu-
lation of trappers, drifting from town to town in the dollar-
hunt, unscrupulous and dissolute; for the law is only for 
those who are not cunning or powerful enough to ignore it. 

The resemblance to Bolshevik Russia is far greater than

one imagines. There is the same breadth of landscape,
which firstly, by excluding any possibility of successful attack
by an invader, consequently excludes the experience
of real national danger, and, secondly, by making the State
not indispensable, prevents the development of any true
political outlook. Life is organized exclusively from the
economic side and consequently lacks depth, all the more
because it contains nothing of that element of historic
tragedy, of great destiny, that has widened and chastened
the soul of Western peoples through the centuries. Their
religion, originally a strict form of Puritanism, has become
a sort of obligatory entertainment, and the War was
a novel sport. And there is the same dictatorship there as
in Russia (it does not matter that it is imposed by society
instead of a party), affecting everything — flirtation and
church-going, shoes and lipstick, dances and novels à la
mode, thought, food, and recreation — that in the Western
world is left to the option of individuals. There is one
standardized type of American, and, above all, American
woman, in body, clothes, and mind; any departure from or
open criticism of the type arouses public condemnation in
New York as in Moscow. Finally, there is an almost Russian
form of State socialism or State capitalism, represented
by the mass of trusts, which, like the Russian economic
administrations, systematically standardize and
control every detail of production and marketing. These
are the real lords of the land in both cases. It is the Faustian
will-to-power, but translated from organic growth to
soulless mechanization. Dollar-imperialism, which per-

invades the whole of America down to Santiago and Buenos 
Aires and seeks to undermine and eliminate West-European 
(and, above all, English) trade, is entirely analogous 
in its control of economic trends by political power to 
Bolshevik imperialism. The Bolshevik motto: “Asia for 
Asiatics,” too, corresponds in principle to the present-day 
conception of the Monroe Doctrine for Latin America — 
namely, all America for the economic power of the United 
States. This is the ultimate meaning of the founding of 
“independent” republics like Cuba and Panama, of the 
intervention in Nicaragua and the overthrow by the might 
of the dollar of unaccommodating presidents right down 
to the extreme South. 

But this “liberty” of existence on the purely economic 
basis, free of state and of law, has its other side. Out of it 
has arisen a sea-power which is beginning to be stronger 
than England’s and controls two oceans. Colonial possessions 
have arisen: the Philippines, Hawaii, islands of the 
West Indies. And business interests and English propaganda 
dragged the country deeper and deeper into the first 
world war, even to the extent of military participation. But 
the United States has thereby become a leading element in 
international politics, whether it would or no, and it must 
either now learn to think and act internally and externally 
in accordance with a State policy or else, in its present 
form, disappear. There is now no going back. Is the 
“Yankee” equal to this difficult task? Does he stand for 
an indestructible kind of life or is he only a fashion in 
physical, mental, and moral clothing? And, moreover, how

many inhabitants of the country are there who inwardly
do not belong to this ruling Anglo-Saxon type? Quite apart
from the Negroes, the immigrants during the twenty years
before the War included — with only a small proportion
of Germans, English, and Scandinavians — no less than
fifteen million Poles, Russians, Czechs, Balkan Slavs,
Eastern Jews, Greeks, inhabitants of Asia Minor, Spaniards,
and Italians. The greater part of these have not been
incorporated in Americanism, but form an alien, foreign-thinking,
and very prolific proletariat with its spiritual
home in Chicago. They, too, desire unrestricted economic
war, but have a different conception of it.

Granted, there is no Communist party. But neither did
this exist as an organization for election purposes in the
Tsarist regime. And in the one country as in the other, there
is a mighty underworld of an almost Dostoievsky sort, with
its own urge to power, its own methods of destruction and
of business, which, in consequence of the corruption prevailing
in the organs of public administration and security,
extends upwards into very prosperous strata of society —
especially as regards that alcohol-smuggling which has
intensified political and social demoralization to the extreme.
It embraces both the professional criminal class
and secret societies of the Ku Klux Klan order, Negroes
and Chinese as well as the uprooted elements of all European
stocks and races, and it possesses some very effective
organizations, certain of which are of long standing, such
as the Italian Camorra, the Spanish Guerrilla, the Russian
Nihilists before 1917, and the agents of the Cheka later.

Lynching, kidnapping, and attempts to assassinate, murder, 
robbery, and arson are all well-tested methods of 
political-economic propaganda. In spacious, thinly peopled 
areas revolutions have necessarily a different form from 
that which they take in West-European cities. The Latin- 
American revolutions give incessant proof of this. Here 
there is no powerful State to be overthrown by fighting an 
army of old traditions, but neither is there one which can 
guarantee the existing order by the respect inspired by its 
existence. What is called “government” is here liable to 
melt away suddenly. Even before the War the trusts had 
often enough to defend their works in strikes by their own 
fortifications and machine-guns. In the “Land of Liberty” 
there is only the resolve of free men to help themselves — 
the revolver in the hip-pocket is an American invention 
— but this form of defence is as freely available for those 
in possession as for the rest. Only a short time ago the 
farmers in Iowa besieged a few towns and threatened them 
with starvation if they did not buy their products at a 
decent price. Not many years since, anyone using the word 
“revolution” in connexion with this country would have 
been called an idiot. Today such ideas are quite in order. 
What will the masses of the unemployed do — I repeat, 
the majority are not “hundred per cent Americans” — 
when their sources of relief are exhausted and there is no 
State support because there is no organized State with exact 
and honest statistics and control of those in want? Will they 
fall back on their fists and their common economic interest 
with the underworld? And will the intellectually primitive

upper class, obsessed as it is by the thought of money, reveal all at once, in face of this danger, dormant moral forces 
that will lead to the real construction of a State and to 
spiritual preparedness to sacrifice possessions and blood to 
it, instead of regarding war as a means of gaining wealth 
as hitherto? Or will the special economic interests of individual areas still pull the most weight and, as once before 
in 1861, lead to the disintegration of the country into separate states such as, say, the industrial North-East, the farming 
region of the Middle West, the Negro states of the 
South, and the area beyond the Rockies? 

Leaving out Japan, which only desires to carry out undisturbed her imperialistic plans in eastern Asia and Australia, there is but one power which would do anything and 
make any sacrifice to bring about this disintegration: England. It has done this before, stopping just short of a declaration of war — namely, in 1862-4 during the War of 
Secession. Warships and privateers for the Southern States 
were built or bought in British harbours at that time. These 
were then armed and manned in European waters — the 
Alabama even with British marines — and proceeded to 
burn and sink the North’s merchant ships wherever they 
encountered them. England was then the undisputed mistress of the seas. This was the one reason which kept Washington from declaring war. The “Freedom of the Seas” 
meant the English freedom to trade, and nothing more. 
Since 1918 that is at an end. England, which in the nineteenth century was the counting-house of the world, is no 
longer rich enough to keep the lead in the present pace of

fleet-construction, and her power is no longer sufficient to 
prevent others by force from outdoing her. The premonition 
of this epochal point in her history was one of the reasons 
for the war against Germany, and November 1918 
probably the last, all-too-short period during which this 
power of yesterday could indulge in the illusion of a great 
victory. But, apart from England’s increasing inferiority 
in warship-construction, the very conception of the command 
of the seas has changed fundamentally. Airplanes 
now rank with submarines as a superior weapon, and the 
hinterland has thus become more important than coasts and 
harbours. Vis-à-vis French bombing squadrons, England 
has ceased strategically to be an island, and England as 
mistress of the seas sinks into the past along with the heavy 
battleship. 

But neither is the English nation strong, young, or healthy 
enough, spiritually and racially, to combat this terrible 
crisis with confidence. Too much of its precious blood was 
spent in the nineteenth century for its possessions, was lost 
by the exodus to the white dominions and by the devastating 
effects of climate in the coloured colonies. Above all, it 
lacks the racial foundation of a tough peasantry. The ruling 
upper class of Germanic or Celtic race — there is no difference 
between them — which dates from the Conquest, has 
been used up. The mass of the original population, erroneously 
called Celts,¹ has forced its way up to a dominant position — 

¹ It is the same race to which the French peasant and bourgeois and 
the majority of Spaniards have belonged from the time when the Nordic 
element in those countries also became exhausted through war and emigration. The true Celtic races came in only in the middle of the first cen-

position by its radically different “French” life-feeling. It 
has, for instance, exchanged the old oligarchic form of 
parliamentary government in the grand manner for the 
Continental and anarchic form of unclean party struggles, 
Galsworthy has described the tragedy of this transition with 
painful penetration in his Forsyte Saga. It is the economic 
victory of the rentier ideal over capitalist imperialism. 
There remain considerable fragments of former wealth, 
but impulse to fight for fresh stocks of it is lacking. The 
methods of trade and commerce are falling slowly out of 
date, and no one has the creative energy to reform them on 
American and German models. The thirst for adventure is 
dying and the young generation has fallen so precipitously 
in mind, morals, and world outlook from the qualitative 
level to which English society had been educated in the previous 
century as to present a phenomenon without parallel 
in the world. The old trumpet-call: “England expects every 
man to do his duty,” which every young Englishman of good 
family at Eton and Oxford before the War felt as directed 
to him personally, now falls on deaf ears. Youth amuses 
itself with Bolshevik problems, goes in for eroticism as a 
sport, and sport as a profession and object in life. Men of

time the Gallic and Britannic nobility, ruling over a far more numerous

Normans.

Shaw hinted in The Apple-Cart that “some” people would 
rather fight out the hopeless struggle against America’s 
preponderance to the end than lay down their arms — but how 
many of these will there be in ten or twenty years? In 1931 
England granted by statute complete equality of status to 
the white Dominions in the commonwealth of nations, 
thereby relinquishing her priority and allying herself with 
these states on the ground of common interests, particularly 
that of protection by the British navy. But there is nothing 
to prevent Canada and Australia from throwing sentiment 
to the winds and turning to the United States if they see a 
chance of better protection there — for instance, from 
Japan, as white nations. England’s former position on the 
farther side of Singapore is already abandoned, and if 
India is lost, there will be no real sense in retaining it in 
Egypt and the Mediterranean either. In vain does English 
diplomacy of the old style try in the old way to mobilize 
the Continent for English ends: against America as the 
debtor front and against Russia as the front against Bolshevism. 
All that is diplomacy from the day before yesterday. 
It had its last fateful success in 1914. And how if Russia 
and America came to an agreement as a result of England’s 
tradition-ridden pride? That is not beyond the bounds of 
possibility. 

In face of such phenomena, in which the world’s destiny 
may be involved for centuries of darkness and confusion, 
the Latin countries have no more than a provincial significance. 
This applies even to France, whose capital is in 
process of becoming a historic sight, like Vienna and Flor-

which half the world already laughs. It is the figure of a 
one-time thruster and hero of valorous deeds, now become 
old, who — with the biggest gold-heap in the world behind 
him, armed to the teeth, hung about with every description 
of armour, surrounded by armed servants — calls to all 
his friends of yesterday for help, looks out in fear and 
trembling from the window of his fortified house, and 
shivers at the sight of every armed neighbour. And this is 
the end of la grande nation. Its heir in the domain of the 
Mediterranean and North Africa may perhaps be Mussolini’s 
creation, if this remains long enough under his rule 
to acquire the necessary spiritual firmness and durability. 

No one can say today whether any of these powers will 
still be in existence in their present form by the middle of 
the century. England may have become limited to her island 
and fallen into America’s clutches. Japan and France, who 
at this time alone know what a strong army is worth, may 
have fallen into the hands of Communistic dictators. Russia’s 
future possibilities can in some respects not even be 
imagined. But the situation at the moment is dominated by 
the conflict of interests between England and Russia in the 
East, and England and America in the West. In both cases 
England is retreating — economically, diplomatically, 
militarily, and morally — and part at least of her lost positions 
are not to be regained even by a war. Does that signify 
the inevitable choice between war and capitulation? 
Or has the failing country no longer even the choice? Most 
Anglo-Saxons on both sides of the Atlantic believe the tie 
of blood and tradition to be so strong that they cannot be

faced with such a decision. But the belief that blood is
thicker than water has not survived the test very well in
the case of England and Germany. Hatred between brothers
has always been stronger in the human race than hatred
of an enemy. It is peculiarly apt to grow suddenly from
small beginnings into a passion from which there is no
retreat.

Such is the look of the world that surrounds Germany.
So situated, a nation without leaders or weapons, impoverished
and torn, cannot count even upon bare existence. We
have seen millions slaughtered in Russia and starved in
China, and for the rest of the world it was but a newspaper
report to be forgotten the next day. Not a human being
abroad would lose his sleep if something still worse happened
anywhere in Western Europe. It is threats that alarm
us; accomplished facts we can put up with. Individuals or
nations may die — and leave no gap. Situated as we are,
we Germans have so far arrived at nothing beyond shouting
for party ideals and general quarrelling for professional
and parochial advantages. But standing out of world politics
does not give protection from the consequences of them.
In the years when Columbus discovered America, and
Vasco da Gama the East Indian trade route, when the West-
European world began to spread its power and riches over
the globe, the Steelyard in London was closed at the request
of English merchants, and with it German merchantmen
vanished from the oceans, because there was no German
flag to be flown from their masts. And with that Germany

at all. It had to carry on its wars with foreign money and in
the service of that money, and it waged wars over miserable
scraps of its own country that one diminutive state took
from another. The great decisions in distant lands were
neither remarked nor understood. Politics were something
so miserable and insignificant that only people of insignificant
character cared to be concerned in them. Will it be so
again, now, in the decades of decision? Are we as dreamers,
enthusiasts, and squabblers to be swallowed up by events,
leaving behind us nothing to lend a certain grandeur to our
historical close? The throwing of the dice for world-mastery
has only just begun. They will be strong players who finish
the game. Are there not to be Germans as well as others
among them?

THE WHITE WORLD-REVOLUTION 


This, then, is the look of the age of world wars, at the beginning 
of which we find ourselves standing. But behind it 
appears the second element of the mighty upheaval, the 
World Revolution. What does it want? In what does it con- 
sist? What does the word at very bottom mean? We are as 
far from understanding its full content today as from grasp- 
ing the historical significance of the first world war, which 
lies behind us. It is not, as half of us think, a question of 
the threat to economic existence from the Bolshevism of 
Moscow, nor, as the other half think, of the “liberation” 
of the working class. These are only surface questions. In 
the first place, this revolution is not a merely impending 
threat. We are in the midst of it, and not since yesterday 
or today, but since more than a century ago. It crosses the 
“horizontal” struggle between states and nations by a 
“vertical” between the ruling classes of the white nations 
and the others, and in the background the far more danger- 
ous second part of this revolution has already set in — the 
whites in general are under attack by the collective mass of 
the “coloured” population of the earth, which is slowly 
becoming conscious of its community. 

This struggle is being waged not only between strata of

humanity but also between strata of the spiritual life right 
down to the individuals. Almost every one of us has this 
opposition of thought and feeling in him, though without 
being conscious of it. That is why so few arrive at seeing 
clearly on which side they stand. But that very fact shows 
the inward necessity of this decision, which reaches far 
beyond one’s personal desires and activities. There is very 
little to be gained out of the catchwords derived from the 
way of thinking that prevails at the moment — such as 
Bolshevism, Communism, class struggle, capitalism, Socialism — each of which is believed by the user to convey the 
exact meaning of the problem simply because he is unable 
to see deep down into the facts. The same thing has occurred in all former Cultures at the equivalent stage, little 
as we know of the details.^ 

But in the case of the Classical Age we do know enough. 
The climax of the revolutionary movement lies in the period 
between the Gracchi and Sulla, but the struggle set in a 
good century earlier with C. Flaminius, whose agrarian 
law of 232 Polybius rightly describes (II, 21) as the begin- 
ning of the demoralization of the masses. This development 
was only temporarily interrupted and diverted by the war 
against Hannibal, towards the end of which slaves were 
drafted to the “citizen” army. From the time of the 
murder of the Gracchi and of their great opponent, the 
younger Scipio Africanus, the power of ancient Roman 
tradition to preserve the State dwindled rapidly. Marius, 
a man of the lower classes, and not even of Roman origin,

created the first army that was based, not on universal conscription, 
but on the recruitment of paid volunteers who 
were personally attached to him, and proceeded with this 
array to launch a pitiless and sanguinary attack on the fundamental 
relationships in Rome. The older generations, 
trained for centuries in the statesmanship and sense of 
moral responsibility that had given Rome its position as 
a world power, were to a large extent exterminated. The 
Roman Sertorius attempted to found a rival state in Spain 
with the aid of the barbarous races there, and Spartacus 
roused the slaves of Italy to wipe out all that Rome meant. 
The war against Jugurtha and the Catilinarian Conspiracy 
revealed the deterioration of the ruling classes themselves, 
whose uprooted elements were prepared at any moment to 
appeal to the country’s enemy and the mob of the Forum 
in support of their sordid financial interests. Sallust was 
perfectly right — it was for the sake of cash, whereof the 
mob and the rich speculators were equally greedy, that the 
honour and greatness of Rome, its race and its idea, went 
down in ruin. But this cosmopolitan mass of people which 
had swarmed into the city from all sides was — just as is 
the case now — not mobilized and organized from within 
to fight for its “ right ” of self-government, its “ liberation ” 
from the oppression of the ruling classes, but from without, 
as a means to the ends of business politicians and professional 
revolutionaries. From these circles there emerged — 
as today — the “dictatorship from below,” which is the 
inevitable final result of radical democratic anarchy. Polybius, with his experience of statesmanship and his keen

eye for the trend of events, foretold this with certainty 
thirty years before C. Gracchus. 

“ So when they begin to lust for power and cannot attain it 
through themselves or their own good qualities, they ruin their 
estates, tempting and corrupting the people in every possible 
way. And hence when by their foolish thirst for reputation 
they have created among the masses an appetite for gifts and 
the habit of receiving them, democracy in its turn is abolished 
and changes into a rule of force and violence. For the people, 
having grown accustomed to feed at the expense of others, 
and to depend for their livelihood on the property of others, 
as soon as they find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded 
from the honours of office by his penury, institute the 
rule of violence; and now uniting their forces massacre, 
banish, and plunder, until they degenerate again into perfect 
savages and find once more a master and monarch.” 

“ And for this change [for the worse] the populace will be 
responsible when on the one hand they think they have a 
grievance against certain people who have shown themselves 
grasping, and when, on the other hand, they are puffed up 
by the flattery of others who aspire to office. For now, stirred 
to fury and swayed by passion in all their counsels, they will 
no longer consent to obey or even to be the equals of the 
ruling caste, but will demand the lion’s share for themselves. 
When this happens the state will change its name to the 
finest sounding of all, freedom and democracy, but will 
change its nature to the worst thing of all, mob-rule.” 

This dictatorship is for the white races of today not a 
mere threat: we are already completely under its sway and 
moreover so submerged and so assured of its normality that 
we do not even notice it. The “ dictatorship of the prole-

proletariat” — that is, of its profiteers—the trade unions and
party officials of all tendencies — is an accomplished fact,
whether governments are actually formed by them or, owing
to the timidity of the “bourgeoisie,” are dominated by
them. This condition was what Marius aimed at, but failed
to obtain, owing to entire want of statesmanlike ability.
But what he lacked his nephew Caesar possessed, and in full
measure. He brought the terrible period of the revolution
to an end by his form of “dictatorship from above,” which
set the unlimited authority of a superior personality in the
place of partisan anarchy. It was a form to which he gave
his name for all time. His murder and its consequences
could not affect it in any way. From his reign onward, the
struggle is waged no longer for gold or to gratify class
hatred, but solely for the possession of absolute power.

With the fight between “Capitalism” and “Socialism”
it has nothing to do. On the contrary, the class of big financiers
and speculators, the Roman equites (a term which
since Mommsen has quite erroneously been translated
“knights”), always had a perfectly good understanding
with the populace and its organizations, the voting clubs
(sodalicia) and the armed bands like those of Milo and
Clodius.^ They supplied money for elections, insurrections,
and bribes, and C. Gracchus in return handed over to them
the provinces for unlimited exploitation under State protection.
There they spread incredible misery by plundering,
usury, and the selling of whole towns into slavery. To crown
all, they took possession of the law-courts, where they were

able to sit in judgment on their own crimes and acquit each 
other. They, for their part, promised the dictator everything, 
only to drop him and his well-meant reforms as soon 
as they had secured their own advantages. This alliance 
between stock exchange and trade unions exists now as then. 
It is part of the natural evolution of such periods, arising 
as it does from a common hatred of State authority and of 
the leaders of productive economy, the two obstacles in the 
way of the anarchic principle of effortless money-making. 
Marius — a political simpleton like so many popular leaders — 
and his backers Saturninus and Cinna, thought no 
differently from Gracchus; and therefore Sulla, the dictator 
of the nationalist side, after the storming of Rome organized 
a terrible butchery among the financiers, from 
which as a class they never recovered. After Caesar they 
completely disappeared from history as a political element. 
Their existence as a political power was intimately bound 
up with the age of democratic party-anarchy and did not 
survive it.

This revolution of more than a century in duration has 
fundamentally nothing to do with economics. It is a long 
disintegration-period in the life of the Culture as a whole, 
considered as a living body. The inward form of the life 
falls to pieces, and with it goes the power to give it outward 
expression through the creative works which collectively 
form the history of states, religions, and arts, after that 
power has matured to its extreme limits. The individual 
man with his private existence follows the trend of the

whole. His doings, his attitude, intention, thought, experience,
inevitably form an element, however small, in this
development. If he confuses this with purely economic
questions, it is already a sign of the decay that is going forward
within himself too, whether he feels and knows it or
not. It goes without saying that economic forms are just
as much a part of civilization as states, religions, ideas,
and arts.^ But what is commonly meant by economics is
not the forms of economic life that grow up and wither
independently of human will, but the material product
of economic activity, which nowadays is simply equated
in the meaning to civilization and history, and the
decline of which is regarded, materialistically and mechanistically,
as the “cause” and content of the world
catastrophe.

The scene of this revolution of life, its foundation, and,
at the same time, its expression, is the Megalopolis which
is found arising in the Late period of all Cultures into
this world of stone and petrifaction flock ever-growing
crowds of peasant folk uprooted from the land, the
“masses” in the terrifying sense, formless human sand
from which artificial and therefore fleeting figures can be
kneaded: parties, organizations modelled on program and
ideal, but in which that inherent power of growth that the
course of the generations had saturated with tradition, and
that most of all expresses itself in the fruitfulness of all
life — the instinct for the permanence of family and race

— is extinct. An abundance of children, the chief sign of 
a healthy race, becomes tiresome and absurd.^ This is the 
gravest sign of the egoism of the Megalopolitans, who have 
themselves become atoms, of the egoism which is the oppo-
site not of present-day collectivism — between these two 
there is no difference ; a pile of atoms is no more alive than 
a single one — but of the urge to live on in the blood of 
posterity, in the creative care for it, in the lastingness of 
the name. Cold intelligence, on the other hand, that solitary 
bloom, the weed of the pavements, sprouts in incredible 
masses. It is no longer the thrifty deep wisdom of old peas-
ant families, which remains true as long as the stock to 
which it belongs endures, but the mere intelligence of the 
day, of the daily papers, ephemeral literature, and national 
assemblies, the bloodless intellect whose criticism gnaws 
away everything that is left standing of the genuine — that 
is, the naturally grown — Culture. 

For the Culture is a growth. The more perfectly a nation 
represents, shows the true stamp and style of, its Culture — 
and amongst the noblest creations of a Culture are its na-
tions themselves — the richer its organic disposition by 
status and rank, and the more genuine the respect of dis-
tances between ranks, from the strong-rooted peasantry to 
the urban patriciate. Here the high level of form, tradition, 
training, and custom, innate superiority in the ruling fami-
lies, circles, and personalities, signify the life, the destiny 
of the whole. A society in this sense remains untouched by 
“rational” classifications and visions, or else it has ceased

to exist. Above all, it is constituted according to rank and 
not “ economic classes.” The latter, the material, English 
point of view — which has developed with and by the 
growth of Rationalism since Adam Smith and was formulated 
in a shallow and cynical system by Marx a century or 
so ago — is not made any more right by the fact that it has 
won out to this moment, when it dominates the entire 
thought, vision, and will of the white nations. It is a sign of 
the decline of society, and nothing more. Before this 
century is through, men will ask themselves in amazement how 
this valuation of social forms and degrees on the basis of 
employer and employed — that is, according to the amount 
of money that the individual has or intends to have as 
fortune, income, or wages — ever came to be taken seriously. 
For under this standard it is the mere amount of money 
that counts, not the social position in which it was acquired 
and turned into a real possession. It is the standpoint of 
proletarians and parvenus, who are at bottom one and the 
same type, the same weed of a metropolitan pavement — 
from the thief and tub-thumping agitator to the speculator 
in stocks or party advantage. 

But “ society ” implies having Culture, having “ form ” 
down to the least detail of manners or thoughts, a “ code ” 
that has been built up by long discipline over whole 
generations, a strict moral outlook on life which penetrates the 
whole of existence with a thousand unspoken and rarely 
conscious obligations and ties, but through them forms all 
members of society into a living unit — often irrespective 
of national frontiers, as was the case with the nobility of

the Crusades and that of the eighteenth century. This it
is that determines rank; this is what is meant by belonging
to society.” Among Germanic races it is called, almost
mystically, honour. This honour was a force which permeated
the lives of whole generations. Personal honour was
only the sense of the unqualified responsibility of the individual
for the social honour, the professional honour, the
national honour. The individual shared the life of the community,
and the existence of the others was at the same
time his own. Whatever he did, the responsibility was
shared by all who came after him, and in those days it was
not only a man’s spirit that died when he was dishonoured,
when his own or his family’s sense of honour had been
mortally wounded, whether by his own fault or a stranger’s.
Everything that we call duty, the basis of all genuine rights,
the original substance of every sort of dignity, may be
traced back to honour. The peasantry and every kind of
handicraftsman, the merchant and the officer, the civil servant
and the prince of ancient lineage — all have their honour.
Those who have it not, those who “see no point in”
maintaining the decencies vis-à-vis themselves as well as
others, are “vulgar.” This is the opposite of nobility, according
to the code of every true society; and not poverty
or want of money, as envious beings suppose today, when
all instinct for superior living and feeling has been lost and
the public manners of all “classes” and “parties” are
equally debased.

Into the old aristocratic society of Western Europe,
which by the end of the eighteenth century had reached a

THE WHITE WORLD-REVOLUTION 


level of existence and refinement of form which could not 
be surpassed and was already becoming fragile and sickly 
in certain respects, the successful Anglo-Puritan bourgeoi-
sie thrust its shoots in the eighteen-forties. Its ambition was 
to vie with the nobility in its mode of life and if possible 
to be merged into it. In this absorption of new currents of 
human life one sees how strong these forms of ancient 
growth were. The planters in Spanish South America and 
English North America had long since formed a true aris-
tocracy on the model of the Spanish grandee and the Eng-
lish lord. The second of these groups was annihilated in 
the Civil War of 1861 and replaced by the parvenus of 
New York and Chicago and their revenues from capital 
milliards. Later, from 1870 onwards, the new German 
bourgeoisie spread itself into the strict life of the Prussian 
officer and official class. But this is the very essence of so-
cial existence: that that which rises to higher rank by its own 
ability and its inward force must be disciplined and en-
nobled by this rigid form and its unconditioned ethic if it 
is thenceforth to represent it and hand it down to posterity 
in sons and grandsons. A live society renews itself perpetu-
ally by precious blood which pours into it from below and 
from outside. The capacity of the living form to take in, 
refine, and assimilate, without becoming unsure in the proc-
ess, is a test of its strength. But as soon as this form of life 
becomes anything but self-evident, or even takes notice of 
critics who dispute the need for its existence, it is all up 
with it. For then one loses sight of the necessity of a struc-
ture that assigns to every sort of person and human activity

their place in the life of the whole — the realization of the 
essential unlikeness, inequality, of the parts that is identical 
with organic formation. One ceases to have a clear conscience 
as to one’s own rank and forgets how to meet subordination 
as a matter of course, but to the same extent the 
lower orders forget, only as a consequence of this, to practise 
this subordination and to recognize it as necessary and 
justified. Here, as always, revolution begins from above, 
only to make way presently for revolts from below. “Universal” 
rights have from time immemorial been given to 
those who had not even thought of claiming them. But society 
rests upon the inequality of men. That is a natural 
fact. There are strong and weak natures, natures born to 
lead or not to lead, creative and untalented, honourable, 
lazy, ambitious, and placid natures. Each has its place in 
the general order of things. The more significant the Culture, 
the more it resembles the structure of a noble animal or 
vegetable body and the greater are the differences between 
its constituent elements — the differences, not the contrasts, 
for these are only introduced by reasoning. No good 
retainer dreams of regarding peasants as his equals, and 
every foreman who knows his job refuses to allow unskilled 
labourers to address him on terms of equality. This is the 
natural feeling in human relations. “Equal rights” are 
contrary to nature, are an indication of the departure from 
type of ageing societies, are the beginning of their irrevocable 
decline. It is a piece of intellectual stupidity to want 
to substitute something else for the social structure that 
has grown up through the centuries and is fortified by tra-

Condition. There is no substituting anything else for Life. After
Life there is only Death.

And that, at bottom, is the intention. We do not seek to
alter and improve, but to destroy. In every society degenerate
elements sink constantly to the bottom: exhausted families,
downfallen members of generations of high breed,
spiritual and physical failures and inferiors. One has only
to glance at the figures in meetings, public-houses, processions,
and riots; one way or another they are all abortions,
men who, instead of having healthy instincts in their body,
have only heads full of disputatiousness and revenge for
their wasted life, and mouths as their most important organ.
It is the dregs of the great cities, the genuine mob, the
underworld in every sense, which everywhere constitute the
opposition to the great and noble world and unite in their
hatred of it: political and literary Bohemia, wastrel nobility
(Catiline and Philippe Égalité, Duke of Orleans), shipwrecked
academicians, adventurers and speculators, criminals
and prostitutes, loiterers, and the feeble-minded, mixed
with a few pathetic enthusiasts for some abstract ideal. A
mushy desire for revenge for some bad luck that has spoilt
their lives, the absence of any instinct of honour and duty,
and an unlimited thirst for money without work and for
rights without responsibilities bring them together. It is
from this befogged milieu that the heroes of the moment of
all popular movements and Radical parties arise. Here the
word “Liberty” takes on the bloody significance that it
has in the declining ages. What is meant is: liberation from
all the bonds of civilization, from every kind of form and

custom, from all the people whose mode of life they feel in 
their dull fury to be superior. Pride and quietly borne poverty, 
silent fulfilment of duty, renunciation for the sake of 
a task or conviction, greatness in enduring one’s fate, loyalty, 
honour, responsibility, achievement: all this is a constant 
reproach to the “humiliated and insulted.” 

For, once more be it said, the opposite of noble is not 
poor, but vulgar. The debased thought and feeling of this 
underworld makes use of the uprooted masses of great 
cities who no longer trust their own instincts, in order to 
achieve their own ends and gratify their desires of revenge 
and destruction. That is why this helpless crowd is so 
persistently inoculated by the spoken and written word 
with “class consciousness” and “class hatred” and why 
the ruling classes — the “rich” and “powerful” — are 
shown, in direct inversion of their real significance, as 
criminals and exploiters, until finally the accusers offer 
themselves as saviours and leaders. All the “people’s 
rights,” the discussion of which was started from above by 
sick consciences and loose Rationalist thinking, are now 
demanded as a matter of course from below by the “disinherited,” never for the people; for they have always been 
given to those who had never thought of asking for them 
and do not know what to do with them. Neither is it desired 
that they should, for these “rights” are not meant for the 
“people,” but for the dregs of self-designated “people’s 
representatives” and out of these a Radical bloc is formed 
whose trade is to fight against the formative forces of the

Culture and puts the masses in tutelage by means of the
franchise, freedom of the press, and terrorism.

Thus is born Nihilism, the abysmal hatred of the proletarian
of higher form of every sort, of culture as its essence,
of society as its upholder and historical product. That anyone
should have “form,” master it, feel comfortable with
it, whereas the common person feels fettered by it and unable
to move freely under it; that tact, taste, a sense for
tradition, should be things that belong to highly cultivated
beings by inheritance; that there are circles in which a
sense of duty and renunciation are not absurd, but lend
distinction: all this fills the Nihilist with a dull fury which
in earlier times crept away into corners and there foamed
at the mouth in the manner of Thersites, but is now widely
diffused in the white nations as an actual world-outlook.
For the Age has itself become vulgar, and most people have
no idea to what extent they are themselves tainted. The bad
manners of all parliaments, the general tendency to connive
at a rather shady business transaction if it promises to
bring in money without work, jazz and Negro dances as the
spiritual outlet in all circles of society, women painted like
prostitutes, the efforts of writers to win popularity by ridiculing
in their novels and plays the correctness of well-bred
people, and the bad taste shown even by the nobility and
old princely families in throwing off every kind of social
restraint and time-honoured custom: all of these go to
prove that it is now the vulgar mob that gives the tone.

But while one half of the world smiles at well-bred forms

and ancient customs, because it no longer regards them as 
inherently imperative and does not suspect that it is a question 
of “to be, or not to be,” the other half is unchaining 
the hatred that burns to destroy, the envy of everything 
that is not available to all, that is prominent and must be 
pulled down. Not only tradition and custom, but every kind 
of refinement — beauty, grace, taste in dress, easy good 
manners, elegance of speech, control of one’s limbs, education 
and self-discipline — irritate the vulgar soul till its 
blood boils. A finely formed face, the light and dainty 
step of a slim girl on the pavement, are contradictions of 
democracy. The preference of otium cum dignitate to boxing 
matches and six-day races, the appreciation of fine 
art and poetry, even the delight in a well-kept garden of 
flowers and rare fruits are things to be burnt, smashed, or 
stamped out. Culture, because of its superiority, is the 
enemy. Its creations cannot be understood or inwardly 
assimilated; because they are not available for all they 
must be annihilated. 

Such is the trend of Nihilism. It occurs to no one to educate 
the masses to the level of true culture — that would be 
too much trouble, and possibly certain postulates for it are 
absent. On the contrary, the structure of society is to be 
levelled down to the standard of the populace. General 
equality is to reign, everything is to be equally vulgar. The 
same way of getting money and the same pleasures to spend 
it on: panem et circenses — no more is wanted, no more 
would be understood. Superiority, manners, taste, and 
every description of inward rank are crimes. Ethical, re-

Religious, national ideas, marriage for the sake of children, 
the family, State authority: all these are old-fashioned and 
reactionary. The picture of the streets of Moscow shows 
the goal, but let no one suppose that it is a spirit from 
Moscow that has conquered here. Bolshevism’s home is 
Western Europe, and has been so ever since the English 
materialist world-view, which dominated the circles where 
Voltaire and Rousseau moved as docile pupils, found effective 
expression in Jacobinism on the Continent. The democracy 
of the nineteenth century already amounted to 
Bolshevism: it lacked only the courage of its logical conclusions. It is only a step from the Bastille and the equality-demanding guillotine to the ideals and street-lighting of 
1848, the year of the Communist Manifesto, and only a 
second step from there to the fall of Western Tsarism. Bolshevism 
does not menace us, it governs us. Its idea of 
equality is to equate the people and the mob, its liberty 
consists in breaking loose from the Culture and its society.

There is one other thing that belongs of necessity to a 
ripe Culture. That is property, the thought of which causes 
delirious outbursts of envy and hatred from the vulgar-minded. 
Property, that is, in the original sense: old and 
permanent possession, inherited from forefathers or acquired 
over long years by the heavy and devoted work of 
the owner and cherished and increased for his sons and 
grandsons. Wealth is not the mere background of superiority, 
but, above all, the result and expression of it, a func-

question not only of the way in which it has been acquired, but
also of the ability needed to shape and use it as a true
cultural element. Let it for once be said outright, though
it is a slap in the face for the vulgarity of the age: property
is not a vice, but a gift, and a gift such as few possess.
For it, too, is the product of long training through generations
of distinction; occasionally it is acquired in families
that have worked their way upward — by self-education
on a groundwork of sound and strong race-character, but
practically never by original talent alone, without some
precondition of educated environment and past example.
It is not a question of how much one has, but of what one
has and the way in which one has it. Mere quantity as an
end in itself is vulgar. One can have, and will to have,
property as a means to power — this is a subordinating
of economic successes to political aims, and it affirms the
ancient experience that money belongs with leadership
in war and State. This was Caesar’s conception when he conquered
and plundered Gaul, and that of Cecil Rhodes
when he got the mines of South Africa into his hands in
order there to found an empire after his own heart. No
poor nation can have great political successes, and so long
as it regards poverty as virtue, and riches as sin, it does not
deserve any. This was the fundamental though only half-
conscious meaning of the old Germanic expeditions by sea
and land, for with the booty acquired, ships were built and
followers enlisted. This type of the will-to-power is hallmarked
by a royal generosity. It is the opposite of greed
and miserliness and equally remote from parvenu prodi-

legality and womanish love of one’s neighbour. But this is 
beside the point. I am speaking of property-owning in so 
far as it implies the tradition of a Culture. It signifies 
inward superiority, it marks a distinction from whole 
classes of people. Not much is needed: a small well-
preserved homestead, a worthy craft reputably practised, a 
tiny garden bearing evidence of cultivation by loving hands, 
a miner’s spotless home, a few books or reproductions of 
classical art. The point is that these objects should be trans-
formed into a personal world, should bear the stamp of 
the owner’s personality. True possessions are soul, and 
only through that soul Culture. To estimate them by their 
money value is, however you look at it, either an incom-
prehension or a desecration. To divide them after the 
owner’s death is a sort of murder. That was the Germanic 
conception of inheritance; morally an indissoluble unit, 
permeated by the soul of the dead owner who had adminis-
tered it, and not a divisible sum. But who realizes this? 
Who today has eyes and feeling for the inward, almost 
metaphysical difference between property and money? ^ 
True estates are those with which one is inwardly bound up, 
as is a Germanic warrior with the arms which he takes 
to the grave with him as his property, a farmer with the 
farm on which his forefathers worked, a merchant of the 
old type with his firm which bears the family name, a true 
craftsman with his workshop and his calling; something, 
in a word, whose value cannot be expressed in words but 
only in a close tie, the breaking of which means death.

That is why real “property” in the deeper sense is always
immovable. It clings to the owner. It consists of things
and is not merely invested^ in them like “fortune,” which
can only be defined quantitatively and has actually no
home. Families who are making their way upward, therefore,
seek a family seat as the original form of real
estate, and those who are descending in the scale try to
turn it into cash. And herein lies one of the differences
between Culture and Civilization.

But “money” is an abstraction, a pure sense of values
in market language, which can only be measured mathematically
by some currency or other. Its sole charm lies
in the fact that one can come into it overnight — whether
by gambling and burglary or by political deals and speculation
with sums that one does not possess — or again
can throw it away from one moment to the next. On this
point proletarians and parvenus are in agreement, and
here too there is an inner relationship between Bolshevism
and Americanism. The money that a Radical politician
or a speculator manages to get, he insists on displaying.
The palaces of the newly-enriched Jacobins, the smart
financiers who began with the French tax-farmers of the
eighteenth century, and the American millionaires, tell
their own tale; and just so was it in ancient Rome, where
the display of all-too-quickly amassed wealth evoked the
satire of Martial, Juvenal, and Petronius. Everything of
course is really spent by such owners upon themselves,

even when they “found” something, “give” lavishly, or 
provide someone else with a subsidy: the spectator is to 
them the essential. Let the whole world know, or what 
good is it? They enjoy the spending as spending. They 
like to play the Maecenas, because they have heard of its 
being “done,” but they get no further than being what 
in Munich is called a Wurzen, a snobbish patron, a copy 
of the Roman Trimalchio. They fill their house with things 
they are unable to appreciate; it is only the price that 
matters. The art-dealers one and all batten on them now as 
in Caesar’s time.^ But the most unmeaning “wasters” and 
debauchees are nevertheless to be found in obscure taverns, 
where unclean gains and party salaries are drunk and 
gambled away, and not in the town-houses of old patricians 
and the country estates of old families. But because 
culture, the tradition of enjoyment which knows how 
to make much out of little, is lacking and cannot be had 
for money, jealousy of this kind of superiority torments 
all vulgar-minded people. This must be said again and 
again, and particularly in these days when “national” 
revolutionaries in Germany rave like mendicant friars 
about universal poverty and squalor — in delightful agreement 
with the Marxists, who declare the possession of 
any sort of wealth to be criminal and immoral and war 
upon everything that has this superiority in things of high 
culture and any who surpass others in the ability to acquire, 
maintain, and worthily use property, and that from envy 
of such ability, which they themselves completely lack.

High culture is inseparably bound up with luxury and
wealth. Luxury, that matter-of-course environment of
things of culture that belongs spiritually to one’s
personality, is a premise of all creative periods. The birth of a
great art, for instance, is not possible at the present time
because the true artistic life died out with the last century.
Then it had its home in “society,” where connoisseurs and
the creators of important works could meet, and not among
art-dealers, art-critics, and snobs, the “people” or the
“public.” And wealth, collected in the hands of the few
and among the ruling classes, is amongst other things the
foundation for the training of generations of leading minds
through the example of a highly developed environment
without which there is no healthy economic life and no
development of political talent. An inventor himself can
be poor, but in a beggarly people there are no great tasks
to bring his gifts to maturity; often, indeed, he is not even
conscious of possessing them. It is the same with the ability
of statesmen and artists. That is why Germans have since
1648 been a world-remote people of theoreticians, poets,
and musicians, for these alone can thrive on no money.
They confused, and still today confuse, romantic visions
with actual policy, for one need not pay a price for visions
— except success. But wealth is a relative conception. To be
“not too well-off” in England in 1770 corresponded to
being very rich in Prussia. And poverty likewise: the Prussian
nobility at its prime was poor, and therefore in comparison
with England poor in statesmanlike qualities; for
these are bred, with few exceptions, in the life of the great

world; but although poor, it did not feel itself as living in
poverty. The absence of any considerable property or income
is no misfortune or misery, so little does its presence
signify happiness in the ordinary sense. Not the fact itself
but a certain brooding over it, the sense of differences as
contrasts, and jealousy, turn it into a misfortune. To feel
miserable one must first be brought to loathe one’s humble
lot, and this has from all time been the demagogue’s interest.
In the Nürnberg of Dürer, say, the plain man enjoyed
without envy the splendour of the upper classes.
Something of the glitter of his own city was reflected in
him; he considered that his life-course depended upon it
and was sure he could never feel happy anywhere else.
It is precisely the labourers and the craftsmen, with their
uneducated reasoning, who are conscious that property
means above all responsibility, care, and work. But from
the eighteenth century, when the Rationalist view of life,
history, and human destiny began to prevail, envy —
which is quite foreign to the nature of good and industrious
workers, was systematically cultivated by the underworld
of democratic politicians and by writers of the moment
such as Rousseau, who by this means earned money

people’s property — which is called “stolen goods,” regardless
of the work and ability put into it — was developed
into a world outlook and produced appropriate
politics from below.

It was only then that the social revolution began to
have the economic tendency which found expression in
agitators’ theories, and this tendency was concerned not
with the organization and aims of the economic system,
but with the monetary value of its investments and products.
Contrasts between rich and poor were created, in
order to start the struggle between them. The idea was
that “everything” available for turning into money should
be shared out or held in common; if possession of it could
not be obtained, it was to be destroyed so that others should
not continue to possess it. From this way of feeling and
thinking, not of the lower orders of society, but of their
self-nominated spokesmen, everything arose that in the
Classical Age was called the equal distribution of goods,
and today is called class war and Socialism. It is the
struggle from above and below of society, and it
is fought between leaders of nations and leaders from
the underworld to whom the working classes are but objects
and means for their own aims. Ageing society puts
up only a feeble defence; its born enemies, however,
continue to attack ruthlessly, until the rising Caesarism of
the proletarian dictatorship makes an end of the Gracchan
and Catilinarian tendencies.

We have thus obtained the premises on which to set out

until the consequences of the first world war had brought
us to the threshold of the decisive decades. Scepticism
(Skepsis), the first requirement for the historic outlook,
for history seeing through itself — just as contempt for
humanity is the essential requirement for a profound
knowledge of it — does not stand at the beginning of things.

This revolution does not commence with the materialistic
Socialism of the nineteenth century, still less with the
Bolshevism of 1917. It has been “in permanence” (to
borrow one of its current phrases) since the middle of
the eighteenth century. It was then that Rational criticism,
proudly named the philosophy of Enlightenment,¹ began
to turn its attention from the theological systems of
Christianity and the traditional world-philosophy of the
scholars — which was nothing more than theology without
the will to system — to the facts of actuality, the
State, society, and finally the evolved forms of economics.
It commenced by depriving the concepts of nation, right,
government, of their historical content, and interpreting
the difference of rich and poor quite materialistically as
a moral contrast, which was insisted upon by the agitators
rather than honestly believed. At this point “Political
Economy” came in, a materialistic science — founded
about 1770 by Adam Smith in association with Hartley,
Priestley, Mandeville, and Bentham — that had the pre-
sumption to regard men as appurtenances of the economic
situation and to “explain” history in the light of prices,

markets, and goods. To it we owe the conception of work,
not as the content of life and calling, but as the commodity
in which the worker trades.^ The whole history of the
formative passions and the creative characters of strong
personalities and races is ignored — the will, focused on
commanding and ruling, on power and booty; the inventive
urge, hatred, revenge, pride in personal strength and its
successes; and equally, on the other side, jealousy, laziness,
the poisonous emotions of the inferior. And there remain
nothing but the “laws” of money and prices, which
find expression in statistics and graphs.

At the same time there set in the flagellantism of the
decaying, all-too-witty society, which could applaud the
satires on its own absurdities. The admirers of The Marriage
of Figaro by Monsieur “de” Beaumarchais, performed
in spite of the royal veto at the Chateau Gennevilliers
to the simpering court nobility; of the novels of Monsieur
“de” Voltaire, devoured in the highest circles from London
to Petersburg; of Hogarth’s drawings, Gulliver’s Travels,
and Schiller’s Robbers and Intrigue and Love (the only
inspired works that exist in revolutionary literature) —
were anything but a lower-class public. As to what was
written by the intellectuals of high society itself, the

Holbach, it is all so very clever in style as to be unintelligible
outside that circle — and it should be remembered
that reading and writing were by no means universal among
even the middle classes.^

All the better were the professional demagogues, who
had learnt nothing but speech-making and pamphlet-
writing, able to see the value of these works as a source for
first-rate catchwords with which to stir up the masses. In
England disturbances began in 1762 with the case of
Wilkes, who was condemned for insulting the Government
in the press, and thereupon elected again and again to the
House of Commons. At meetings and in systematic riots
the war-cry was: “Wilkes and Liberty,” rioting for the
cause of freedom of the press, universal suffrage, and even
a republic. In that period Marat had written, in England
and for Englishmen, The Chains of Slavery (1774). The
revolt of the American colonies in 1776 and their proclamation
of the universal rights of man and the Republic, their trees
of liberty and associations were in reality the
outcome of English movements during these years.^ From
1779 onward there arose the clubs and secret societies
which spread over the whole country, aimed at revolution,
and from 1790, headed by Fox and Sheridan, sent congratulatory
addresses, letters, and advice to the Convention
and the Jacobins. Had not the reigning English plutoc-

democracy has been far more vigorous than the cowardly court of
Versailles, revolution would have broken out in London
earlier than in Paris. The Paris clubs, particularly the
Feuillants and Jacobins, were nothing but copies of the
English in their programs, their organization of branches
all over France, and the form of their agitation; while the
English in turn translated “citoyen,” the French form of
address between members, into “citizen” and the newly-
coined “citizeness,” and adopted, further, the phrase
“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity” and the designation “tyrants”
for kings. Since then, and even in our own time,
this remains the form which preparation for revolution
takes. It was in those days that there arose the “universal”
demand for freedom of the press and of public meetings
as a means thereto — the central demand of political Liberalism,
the desire to be free from the ethical restrictions of
the old Culture. Yet the demand was anything but universal;
it was only called so by the ranters and writers who
lived by it and sought to further private aims through this
freedom. But the older society itself, obsessed as it was by
esprit, the “educated” classes corresponding to the philistines
of the nineteenth century — that is, the very victims
of this freedom — exalted it into an ideal which stood
above any criticism of its background. Today, when both

opinions. In 1793 the political clubs on Anglo-French models had to be

century lie before us, we may be permitted to discuss it.
Freedom from what, for what? Who financed the press and
the agitation? Who gained by it? These liberties have
shown themselves everywhere in their true light: as a
means to be used by Nihilism in levelling society, and by
the underworld in inoculating the masses of the great cities
with the particular opinion — it has none of its own —
which promises the best result for its aims. This is why
these liberties, of which universal suffrage is one, are
checked, suppressed, and completely inverted, once they
have done their work and given the power into the hands
of their exploiters. It was so in Jacobin France in 1793, in
Bolshevist Russia, and in Germany’s trade-union Republic
of 1918. When were there more suppressions of newspapers,
in 1820 or in 1920? Liberty has always been the
liberty of those who wish to obtain the power, not to
abolish it.



This active Liberalism progresses from Jacobinism to
Bolshevism logically. These are not in opposition of
thought and will, but are the Early and the Late form, the
beginning and the end, of one single movement. It began
about 1770 with sentimental “social-political” tendencies;
the structure of society according to class and rank was to
be destroyed; and there was to be a “Return to Nature,” to
the uniformity of the herd. The place of class was to be
taken by that which has no class: money and intelligence,
countinghouse and lecturer’s chair, arithmeticians and

clerks; in place of form-ordered existence, life without
form, manners, obligations, respect. It was only about
1840 that this “social-political” tendency passed into an
“economic-political” one. The scapegoats are now no
longer the aristocrats, but the possessors, from peasant to
entrepreneur. The disciples of the movement are promised,
not equal rights, but the privilege of the unpropertied; not
freedom for all, but the dictatorship of the city proletariat,
the “workers.” But this represents no change of a world
outlook—which was, and still is, materialistic and utilitarian—but solely a change in revolutionary methods.
The professional demagogues now mobilize a different section
of the nation for class war. At first, about 1770, peasants
and craftsmen were approached with some hesitation,
both in England and in France. The cahiers of small-town
and country deputies in 1789, which were supposed to
represent the “Cry of the Nation,” were composed by professional
ranters¹ and were not understood at all by the
greater part of the electorate. These classes were too deeply
rooted in tradition to be unconditionally available as
means and weapons. Without the mob from the eastern
suburbs—the fists of the capital, always handy—the
Reign of Terror in Paris would have been impossible. It is
not true that the problem was one of economic necessities.
Rates and taxes were sovereign rights. Universal suffrage
was intended as a blow against the structure of society.

men were no reliable following for professional demagogues.
They possessed a native sense of respect and
self-respect. They had too much instinct and too little town-
intelligence. They were industrious and had learnt something;
besides, they wished to leave the farm or the workshop
to their sons. No permanent effect could be made
upon them by programs and catchwords.

Only about 1840 did the pamphlet-and-platform demagogy
of Western Europe,¹ whose development had proceeded on uniform lines, discover a better medium for
their ends in the uprooted mass of men who had gathered
round the North-European coal area² — the type of the
industrial worker. It is time we were clear in our own
minds about one fact which has been completely smothered
in the mist of the party politicians' wars: it was not
the “economic distress,” into which “capitalism” had
brought the “proletariat,” that led to the rise of Socialism,
but the professional agitation which created this “clear-
eyed” outlook on things, just as it had drawn an utterly
false picture of the distressed peasant class before 1789³ —
purely because it hoped thereby to get a whole-hearted
following. And the uneducated and half-educated middle
class believed in this picture and does so to this day.

them. * Politische Schriften, pp. 331 et seq.

1848, without consideration of its meaning and the limits
of its application. And the “working class,” which does
not exist in the economic structure of a single nation —
for what have miners, sailors, tailors’ apprentices, metal-
workers, waiters, bank officials, ploughmen, and scaven-
gers in common with one another? — becomes a political
reality, an attacking party, which has split all “white”
nations into two armies, of which the one has to feed, and
to give its blood for a host of party agents, tub-thumpers,
newspaper-writers, and “people’s representatives,” who
pursue their own private aims. That is the purpose for
which it exists. The contrast between Capitalism and So-
cialism — words for which, all this time, literature has
searched in vain for a definition, for catchwords are not to
be defined — is not derived from any reality, but is purely
a built-up challenge. Marx introduced these terms into the
English engineering industry, he did not draw them from
it; and even so he could only do it by ignoring the existence
of all the people engaged in agriculture, commerce, traffic,
and administration. This picture of the time had so little
to do with the world of reality and its inhabitants that, in
theory, the South even became separated from the North:
the boundary lay somewhere about the line Lyon-Milan.
In the Latin South, where one needs little to live on and
does little work, where there is no coal and therefore no
industrialism, where thought and feeling are racially dif-
ferent, there developed anarchist and syndicalist tenden-
cies whose wish-picture was the dissolution of the great

national organisms into systemless, small self-sufficing 
groups, Bedouin-like swarms occupied in doing nothing. 
But in the North, where hard winters mean harder work 
and make such work not only possible but essential, where 
from time immemorial the battle has been against hunger 
and cold combined, there arose out of the Germanic will- 
to-power, and its urge to large-scale organisation, systems 
of authoritarian Communism which aim at a proletarian 
dictatorship over the whole world. And, simply because in 
the nineteenth century the coalfields of these northern lands 
had attracted an assemblage of people and of national 
wealth of a hitherto unheard-of order of magnitude, a very 
different impetus was given to demagogy both within them 
and outwards from their boundaries. The high wages 
of English, German, and American factory-workers triumphed, 
precisely because they were anything but “starvation 
rates,” over the low wages of the land-workers in the 
South, and only because of this “capitalistic” superiority 
of party means did Marxism triumph over the theories of 
Fourier and Proudhon. The peasantry had already ceased 
to exist for all of them. As a weapon in the class war it had 
small value, not merely because it was not available on the 
pavements at any and every moment, but also because its 
traditions of property and labour were contrary to the 
views of theory. It was therefore ignored by the catch- 
words of the Communist program. Bourgeoisie and prole- 
tariat — that is a picture one can take in, and the simpler 
one is, the less one notices how much there is left outside 
this scheme.

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

Every demagogy forms its program according to the sec- 
tion of the nation which it hopes to mobilize for its purpose. 
In Rome, from Flaminius to C. Gracchus, it was the Italian 
peasant farmers who wanted land, so that they might till it. 
Hence the division of the Gallic area south of the Po by 
the former and the demand for the division of the ager 
publicus by the latter. But Gracchus went under because 
the peasants, who had moved into Rome in masses to vote, 
had to go home again for the harvest. After this experience 
the demagogy of the type of Cinna and Catiline had to rely 
upon slaves and, above all, instead of on industrious 
journeymen (like demagogy in the Greek cities from 
Cleon’s time) upon the unskilled populace of mixed origins 
which prowled about the streets of Rome and asked to be 
fed and amused: panem et circenses. And precisely be- 
cause, for the next century, these masses had to be won 
over by ever-increasing expenditure, they grew, even after 
Caesar, to a size which made them a standing danger to the 
Government of the world empire. The lower the type of 
such a following, the more usable it is. For this reason has 
Bolshevism, ever since the Paris Commune of 1871, made 
far less effort to influence the skilled, industrious, and 
sober worker than the work-shy rabble of the cities which 
is ready at any time to plunder and murder. For this reason 
also have the ruling trade-unionist parties in Germany, 
from 1918 right into the peak years of unemployment, 
been careful to allow no legal differentiation between the 
workless and the work-shy. At that time, while assistance 
was being given to the supposed unemployed, there was a

dearth of workers, especially on the land, and no one seriously 
tried to remedy it. The sickness-relief funds were 
misused by thousands as a way of evading work. Unemployment 
in its early stages was positively fostered by 
Marxism. The concept “proletarian” excludes all joy in 
work. A worker who knows his job and is proud of his 
achievement has no qualifications for proletarianism. He 
is a drag on the revolutionary movement. He has to be proletarianized, 
demoralized, before he is of use to it. That is 
the true Bolshevism by which this Revolution will reach its 
climax, but by no means its close. 

It is characteristic of the superficial way in which the 
whole “white” world thinks that this Bolshevism is regarded 
as a Russian creation, threatening to conquer Europe. 
Actually, it was born in Western Europe, and born indeed 
of logical necessity as the last phase of the Liberal 
democracy of 1770 and the last triumph of political Rationalism — 
which is to say, of the presumptuous intention 
to control living history by paper systems and ideals. Its 
first outbreak on a large scale, after the June conflicts of 
1848, was the Paris Commune of 1871, which came near to 
mastering the whole of France.* Only the army prevented 
it — that and the German policy which gave the army its 
moral support. It was then, and not in Russia in 1917, that 
out of the facts of a besieged capital were born the workers’ 
and soldiers’ councils which Marx (a simpleton in practical 
matters) ever afterwards commended as the possible

form for a Communist government. It was then that the
mass slaughters of opponents were carried out which cost
France more lives than the whole of her war against Germany.
It was then that the work-shy rabble were in power,
and not the working class: deserters, criminals and bullies,
literary men and journalists, with among them, as always,
many foreigners: Poles, Jews, Italians, and even Germans.
But it was a specifically French form of revolution. There
was no mention of Marx, but all the more of Proudhon,
Fourier, and the Jacobins of 1792. A loose alliance of the
large cities (that is, of their lowest classes) was to overthrow
and conquer the open country and provincial towns
— a notion typical of Latin anarchy. Something similar
had been attempted in 1411 by the butcher Caboche with
the militarily organized Parisian populace, and the same
idea was copied faithfully in Petersburg in 1917 with
just such another “Western” populace and with the same
catchwords. The “Asiatic” side of this Russian revolution,
however, which hardly emerged at the time and has
still not succeeded in overcoming the Western Communistic
forms of Soviet rule, found its earliest expression
in Pugatchev’s insurrection (1772-5), which seized the
whole of the Upper Volga region and even for a time
Moscow, putting Tsarism itself in peril. The fanatically
religious peasantry, including whole Cossack tribes,
killed everything in the way of representatives of Petrine,
European-made Russia who fell into their hands — off-

“ It was God’s will that Russia should be chastised by me, His humble
tool,” said Pugatchev, when brought before his judges.

officers, officials, and, above all, the new nobility. They would 
have treated the representatives of the Soviet bureaucracy 
in the same way, and their descendants would gladly have it 
happen today — perhaps they will really do it tomorrow. 
Hatred of this foreign type of government, against which 
the Moscow of these days is less and less able to defend 
itself, is very old; it goes back to the insurrection of the 
“Strelitz” against Peter the Great. Democrats and Socialists 
from the West cannot appreciate a feeling so alien to 
their own way of thinking. It marks the contrast between 
the real Bolshevism, which seethes underground among 
all “white” nations and has produced these very democrats 
and Socialists, and that other form, the hatred which 
is piling up among all the coloured populations of the 
world against the whole white civilization, its revolutionary 
currents with the rest. 

And now what is the attitude of “society” in the West-European 
Civilization since 1770, and particularly since 
1848, towards the fact of this revolution from below, 
which has long since reached the stage of scorning and 
deriding its Liberal beginnings and the concessions they 
have won, such as freedom of the press, of unions, and 
of meeting, finally universal suffrage — after exploiting 
them to the furthest limits of disintegration? By “society” 
we mean here that which is now generally called the 
“middle classes” in England and the “bourgeoisie” on 
the Continent — the peasants being, as usual, ignored.

expression of this hatred of town against country.

It is a chapter of shame that here presents itself to the
historian of the future. Built up though it was on the
basic human facts of rulership, grade, and property, so-
ciety met the Nihilist attack upon these with submis-
sion, “understanding,” acclamation, and support. This
intellectual suicide was the common fashion of last
century.

It must be stated again and again that this society, in
which in our own time the transition from Culture to Civili-
zation is taking place, is sick, sick in its instincts and there-
fore in its mind. It offers no defence. It takes pleasure
in its own vilification and disintegration. From the middle
of the eighteenth century it has broken up more and more
into Liberal and Conservative circles — the latter repre-
senting merely the opposition set up in desperate self-
defence against the former. On the one side there is a
small number of people who, possessed of the true politi-
cal instinct, see what is going on and whither it is leading
and exert themselves to prevent, moderate, or divert ac-
cordingly; people of the kind who formed Scipio’s circle
in Rome (and whose outlook inspired Polybius’s histori-
cal work), and, again, Burke, Pitt, Wellington, and Dis-
raeli in England, Metternich, Hegel, and Bismarck in
Germany, and Tocqueville in France. They sought to de-
fend the conserving force of the old Culture — State,
monarchy, army, consciousness of standing, property, peas-
antry — even in cases where they had reason to object,
and are therefore cried down as “reactionary.” This
word, which the Liberals invented, is thrown back at them

now by their Marxian pupils, in that they try to prevent 
the logical outcome of their actions; such is our reputed 
progress. On the other side stands almost everything that 
has the urban intelligence or, if not, at least looks up to 
it as the badge of superiority in the conditions of today 
and in terms of the power of the future — the future that 
is already the past. 

At this point journalism becomes the dominant expression 
of the time. It is the critical esprit of the eighteenth 
century diluted and lightened for intellectual mediocrity 
— and let us not forget that krinein means to part, to 
dissect, to disintegrate. Drama, poetry, philosophy, even 
science and history ^ are turned into leading articles and 
feuilletons written with an unashamed bias against everything 
that is conservative and has formerly inspired respect. “ Party ” becomes the Liberal substitute for rank 
and State; revolution, in the form of periodic mass elections 
fought by all available means of money, brains, and 
even — after the Gracchan method — physical violence, 
is exalted into a constitutional process; government, as 
the meaning and duty of State existence, is either opposed 
and derided or degraded to the level of a party business. 
But the blindness and cowardice of Liberalism goes 
further still. Tolerance is extended to the destructive forces 
of the city dregs, not demanded by them. In Western

Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Gracchen and Caesars Monarchie and

In Europe Russian Nihilists and Spanish anarchists are
gushed over in “good” society with revolting sentimentality
and passed on from one fashionable hostess to another.
In Paris and London, above all in Switzerland,
both they and their undermining activities are carefully
protected. The Liberal press rings with maledictions of
the prisons in which the martyrs of liberty languish,

The concept of the proletariat, created of deliberate intention

feeling and thinking to a binding world-view, “People” 
no longer meant the community of the whole nation, but 
that section of the city masses which set up in opposition 
to this community. The proletarian appeared as the hero 
on the stage of the progressive bourgeoisie, and with him 
the prostitute, the shirker, the agitator, the criminal. From 
this time onward it has been “modern” and superior to 
see the world from below, from the perspective of a bar 
parlour or a street of ill repute. The cult of the proletarian 
arose during that period, and in the Liberal circles of 
Western Europe, not in 1918 in Russia. A fatal notion 
of things, half false and half stupid, began to pervade 
educated and semi-educated minds: “the worker” becomes 
the real person, the real nation, the meaning and 
aim of history, politics, public care. The fact that all men 
work, and moreover that others — the inventor, the 
engineer, the organizer — do more, and more important, 
work is forgotten. No one any longer dares to bring for- 
ward the class or quality of his achievement as a gauge 
of its value. Only work measured in hours now counts as 
labour. And the “worker,” with all this, is the poor 
unfortunate one, disinherited, starving, exploited. The words 
“care” and “distress” are applied to him alone. No one 
has a thought left for the countryman’s less fertile strips of 
land, his bad harvests, his losses by hail and frost, his 
anxiety over the sale of his produce; or for the wretched 
existence of poor craftsmen in strongly industrialized 
areas, the tragedies of small tradesmen, fishermen on 
the high seas, inventors, doctors, who have to struggle

amid alarms and dangers for each bite of daily bread and 
go down in their thousands unheeded. “The worker” 
alone receives sympathy. He alone is supported, cared for, 
insured. What is more, he is made the saint, the idol, of 
the age. The world revolves round him. He is the focus 
of the economic system and the nurseling of politics. Everybody’s 
existence hinges on him; the majority of the nation 
are there to serve him. The dull lump of a peasant, the 
lazy official, the swindling tradesman, are all legitimate 
targets for mirth, not to mention judges, officers, and heads 
of businesses, who are the popular objects of ill-natured 
jest; but no one would dare to pour the same scorn on “the 
working man.” All the rest are idlers, egoists; he is the 
one exception. The whole middle class swings the censer 
before this phantom. No matter what one’s own achievements 
in life may be, one must fall on one’s knees before 
him. His being stands above all criticism. It was the middle 
classes who successfully “put over” this notion of 
him, and the very business-like “representatives of the 
people” continue to sponge upon the legend. They dinned 
it into the wage-earners until they believed it; until they 
felt themselves to be really ill-treated and wretched, until 
they lost all sense of proportion with regard to their output 
and their importance. Liberalism vis-à-vis the demagogic 
trend is the form of suicide adopted by our sick 
society. With this perspective it gives itself up. The merciless, 
embittered class war that is waged against it finds 
it prepared to capitulate politically, after having helped 
spiritually in the forging of the enemy weapons. Only

Who is it, then, who has flattered and organized this mass 
of wage-earners in the cities and industrial areas, provided 
them with catchwords, driven them by cynical propaganda 
into the class war against the majority of the nation? It 
is not the industrious and highly trained workman, the 
“vagabond,” as he is contemptuously called in the Marx- 
Engels correspondence. In a letter to Marx on the 9th May 
1851 Engels speaks of the democratic Red and Communist 
mob, and on the 11th December 1851 writes to him: 
“What is the rabble good for if it forgets how to fight?” 
The manual worker is merely a means to the private ends 
of professional revolutionaries. He is to fight for the satis- 
faction of their hatred of the conservative forces and their 
thirst for power. ^ If only workers were to be recognized 
as representatives of the workers, the benches on the Left 
would be very empty in all parliaments. Among the origi-

Europe in which Bolshevism grew up from the middle of 
the nineteenth century was composed of the same elements 
which went to the making of the revolutionary Liberalism 
of 1770. Whether the February Revolution of 1848 in Paris 
was for “ Capitalism ” or that of June against it, whether 
“ Liberty and Equality ” were to be secured for the middle 
class in 1789 or for the lower orders in 1793 and 1918, the 
aims of the inciters of these movements and their ultimate 
motives were in fact all exactly the same ; and no different 
is the situation in Spain today, and perhaps that in the 
United States tomorrow. It is from the intellectual “ mob,” 
with the failures from all academic professions, the 
spiritually unfit and morally inhibited, at its head, that the 
gangsters of Liberal and Bolshevist risings are recruited. 
Their “ dictatorship of the proletariat ” — which is to say, 
their own dictatorship with the help of the proletariat — 
is to be their revenge on those who are happy and successful, 
as a last means of appeasing the morbid vanity and 
vulgar greed for power which alike arise from unsettled 
self-respect, the final expression of depraved and misdirected 
instincts. 

Among all these jurists, journalists, schoolmasters, 
artists, and technicians one is apt to overlook one type, the 
most sinister of all: the sunken priest. Religion is the personal 
relation to the powers of the world around us, 
expressed in a world view, in pious usages and the personal 
attitude of renunciation. A church is the organization 

opinion the only conscious aim of the worker should be to arrive by way of 
a party secretaryship at mass-leadership.

of a priesthood which fights for its temporal power. It 
brings the forms of religious life, and therewith the people 
who cling to them, under its power, and it is therefore the 
born enemy of all other forms of power: State, rank, or 
nation. During the Persian Wars the priesthood of Delphi 
agitated on behalf of Xerxes and against the national defence. 
Cyrus was able to conquer Babylon and overthrow 
Nabonid, the last king of the Chaldees, because the priesthood 
of Marduk was in league with him. The histories of 
ancient Egypt and ancient China are full of examples of the 
sort, and in the West there was only occasionally truce between 
monarchy and church, throne and altar, nobility and 
priesthood, when an alliance between them against a third 
party promised to be advantageous. “My kingdom is not 
of this world” is the deep saying which is true of every 
religion and is betrayed by every church. But every church 
from the very fact of its existence falls in with the conditions 
of historical life; it thinks in terms of political power and 
material economy; it wages war in diplomatic and military 
fashion, and shares with other institutions of power the 
consequences of youth and age, rise and decay. Above 
all, in respect of conservative policy and tradition in State 
and society, it is not honest and qua church cannot be so. 
All young sects are at bottom hostile to State and property,

live as it may be with regard to itself, is always being
tempted to become in relation to State and society Liberal,
democratic, or Socialistic — that is, levelling and
destructive — as soon as the struggle between tradition and
the mob sets in.

All priests are human beings, and hence the fate of
churches becomes dependent upon the human material
of their continuously changing personnel. Even the strict-
est selection — and it is as a rule masterly — cannot
prevent vulgar instincts and vulgar thought from becoming
frequent and even predominant in times of social
degeneration and revolutionary demolition. In all such times
there is a priest-rabble which drags the dignity and faith
of the church through the mud of party politics, allies
itself with the revolutionary forces, and, by sentimental
talk about loving one’s neighbour and helping the poor,
eggs on the underworld to set about destroying the social
order — that order with which the church is irrevocably
and fatally bound up. A religion is that which the soul of
the faithful is. A church is worth just so much as the
priest-material of which it is composed is worth.

At the beginning of the French Revolution we have, besides
the swarm of degenerate abbes, who for years had
mocked at authority and rank in their writing and
preaching, the runaway monk Fouche and the renegade bishop
Talleyrand, both of them regicides and thieves en grand,
Napoleonic dukes and traitors to their country. From 1815
onward the Protestant priest tends to become more and
more a democrat, Socialist, and party politician. Lutheran-

ism, which is hardly a church, and Puritanism, which is
not one at all, have neither of them as such promoted any
destructive policy. The individual priest went on his own
account among “the people” and into the workers’ party,
spoke in electoral assemblies and parliaments, wrote on
“social” questions, and ended as a demagogue and Marxian.
The Catholic priest, however, who was more firmly
attached to his church, pulled it over with him. It became
woven into the party agitations, at first as an effective
medium and finally as a sacrifice to this policy. A Catholic
trade-union movement with Socialist-Syndicalist tendencies
existed in France as early as Napoleon III’s reign.
In Germany the first example of such arose after 1870, inspired
by the fear that the “Red” trade unions would
gain sole power over the masses in the industrial areas.
And it at once came to an understanding with these. All
workers’ parties are dimly aware of their common cause,
however much the executive groups may hate each other.

Truly, it is a long time since Leo XIII’s view of world
politics commanded a following, and a true prince of the
church like Cardinal Kopp ruled over the clergy in Germany.
At that period the church was conscious of being
a conservative force, and it knew well that its fate was
bound up with that of the other conservative forces —
State authority, monarchy, the social order, and property
— that it stood, in the class war, unconditionally against
the Liberal and Socialist forces, on the “Right,” and that
its prospect of outlasting the revolutionary age depended
upon doing so. But the change has come quickly. Spiritual

discipline is shaken. The activities of the mob element 
in the priesthood tyrannize over the church right up to 
the highest positions, and those who hold them are forced 
to keep silence to hide their impotence from the world. 
Church diplomacy, formerly directed from above in so 
distinguished a manner, and exercising its tactical judgment 
over things decades ahead, gives way increasingly 
to the vulgar methods of day-to-day politics, to party 
democratic agitation from below, with its contemptible 
dodges and specious argumentation. Thought and action are 
on the level of the cosmopolitan underworld. The traditional 
striving for temporal power is reduced to petty 
ambition in the direction of election successes and alliances 
with other “mob” parties for the sake of material results. 
The mob element in the priesthood, once severely curbed, 
now prevails, with its proletarian way of thinking, over 
the really worthy section of the clergy that considers the 
soul of a man to be worth more than his vote and takes 
metaphysical problems more seriously than demagogic 
raids upon economic life. Tactical mistakes, such as the 
Spaniards made in imagining they could separate the 
destinies of throne and altar, would not have been made 
a few decades back. But since the end of the World War 
the church — in Germany above all, where, being an 
ancient power of rigid traditions, it had to pay heavily 
in prestige with its own adherents by descending to street 
level — has sunk to class wars and association with Marxism. 
There is in Germany a Catholic Bolshevism which

is more dangerous than the anti-Christian because it hides 
behind the mask of a religion. 

Now, all Communist systems in the West are in fact 
derived from Christian theological thought: More’s Utopia, 
the Sun State of the Dominican Campanella, the doctrines 
of Luther’s disciples Karlstadt and Thomas Münzer, and 
Fichte’s State Socialism. What Fourier, Saint-Simon, Owen, 
Marx, and hundreds of others dreamed and wrote on the 
ideals of the future reaches back, quite without their 
knowledge and much against their intention, to priestly-
moral indignation and Schoolmen concepts, which had their 
secret part in economic reasoning and in public opinion 
on social questions. How much of Thomas Aquinas’s law 
of nature and conception of State is still to be found in 
Adam Smith and therefore — with the opposite sign — 
in the Communist Manifesto! Christian theology is the 
grandmother of Bolshevism. All abstract brooding over 
economic concepts that are remote from any economic 
experience must, if courageously and honestly followed 
out, lead in one way or another to reasoned conclusions 
against State and property, and only lack of vision saves 
these materialist Schoolmen from seeing that at the end of 
their chain of thought stands the beginning once more; 
effective Communism is authoritative bureaucracy. To put 
through the ideal requires dictatorship, reign of terror, 
armed force, the inequality of a system of masters and 
slaves, men in command and men in obedience — in short: 
Moscow. But there are two sorts of Communist. The one,

The credulous type, obsessed by doctrine or feminine sentimentality,
remote from and hostile to the world, condemns
the wealth of the wicked who prosper and also, at
times, the poverty of the good who do not prosper. This
lands him either in vague Utopias or throws him back upon
asceticism, the monastic life, Bohemia, or vagabondism,
which proclaim the futility of all economic effort. But the
other, the “worldly” type with the realist political outlook,
hopes through its followers to destroy society, either
from envy or revenge, because of the low place assigned
in it to their personality and talents, or, alternatively, to
carry away the masses by some program or other for the
satisfaction of his own will-to-power. But this, too, likes
to hide itself under the cloak of some religion.

Marxism is indeed a religion, not in the sense of its
founder, but in that which his revolutionary following has
imparted to it. Like any church it has its saints, apostles,
martyrs, fathers, bible and mission. Like any church it
has dogmas, heresy-tribunals, an orthodoxy and a scholasticism,
and, above all, a popular moral — or rather
two, for believers and unbelievers. And does it make any
difference that its doctrine is materialistic through and
through? Are those priests who agitate on economic questions
any less so? What are, actually, Christian trade
unions? Christian Bolshevism, neither more nor less. Since
the beginning of the Rationalist age — that is, since 1750
— there is materialism both with and without Christian terminology.
As soon as one mixes up the concepts of poverty,
hunger, distress, work, and wages (with the moral under-

tone of rich and poor, right and wrong) and is led thereby
to join in the social and economic demands of the proletarian
sort — that is, money demands — one is a materialist. And then the pressing inward need for a high altar
is supplied by the party secretariat, for a poor-box by
election funds — and the trade-union official becomes the
successor to St. Francis.

This materialism of the Late megalopolis is a practical
cast of thought and action, whatever the “faith” may be
that accompanies it. It is the mode of regarding history
and public and personal life “economically” and of
looking upon economics, not as a thing of vocations and
the content of lives, but as the method by which with the
least exertion the most money and pleasure can be secured;
panem et circenses. Most people nowadays do not realize
at all how materialistic they are in themselves and their
thought. They may be zealous in prayer and confession
and have the word “God” for ever on their lips,^ they
may even be priests by calling and conviction, and yet be
materialists. Christian morality is, like every morality,

^ The very prevalence of this fashion in speech and writing today shows
that the word has become a catchword, an empty concept, and anything but
the expression of religious renewal and inner experience. There are profound
religions and great men’s religious convictions that are atheistic, pantheistic,
or polytheistic, in China, India, the Classical world, and in the West today.
The old Germanic word god was a neuter plural and was only turned into
a masculine singular by Christian propaganda. The way in which we seek
to interpret the impenetrable mystery of the world around and the fact that
we do it have nothing to do with the order of the religious view and attitude.
But here there is confusion of “religious” with “confessional,” the acknowledgment
of certain doctrines and precepts, and with “clerical,” the recognition
of the claims of a priesthood. In reality the profundity of a religion
depends upon the personality of him in whom it lives. Without lay piety
even a definitely priestly religion is non-viable.

renunciation and nothing else. Those who do not feel it 
to be so are materialists. “In the sweat of thy face shalt 
thou eat bread” means: do not regard this hard meaning 
of life as misery and seek to circumvent it by party politics. 
But for proletarian election propaganda the precept is 
certainly not suitable. The materialist prefers to eat the 
bread that others have earned in the sweat of their face, the 
peasant, the craftsman, the inventor, the captain of industry. 
But the famous “eye of a needle,” through which 
many a camel passes, is not too narrow for the “rich man” 
only; it is equally narrow for the man who extorts bigger 
wages and shorter working hours by means of strikes, 
sabotage, and elections—and for him, too, who engineers 
these for the sake of his own power. It is the utility-moral 
of the slave-souls: slaves, not because of their situation in 
life—for that we are all without exception, from the 
destiny of being born at a particular time and place— 
but because to regard the world from below is mean. Does 
one regard the state of being rich with envy or with contempt? 
Does one acknowledge the man who has by personal 
superiority worked his way up to the rank of a 
leader—from locksmith’s apprentice, say, to founder 
and owner of a factory—or hate him and try to pull 
him down? That is the test. But this materialism, to which 
renunciation is incomprehensible and absurd, is nothing 
but egoism of individuals and classes, the parasitic egoism 
of inferior minds, who regard the economic life of other 
people, and that of the whole, as an object from which to

squeeze with the least possible exertion the greatest possible
enjoyment: panem et circenses. Such people look
upon personal distinction, industry, success, joy in achievement
as wickedness, sin, and treason. It is the moral of
class war, which lumps all this together under the name
Capitalism (which had from the first a moral significance
and sets it up as a target for proletarian hate, while on
the other side it aims at welding the wage-earners into
one political front with the underworld of the great
cities.

Only the “worker” is permitted and commanded to
be an egoist, not the peasant or craftsman. He alone has
rights instead of obligations. The others have obligations
and no rights. He is the privileged class whom the others
have to serve by their labour. The economic life of the nation
exists for him and must be organized solely with a
view to his comfort, whether it falls to pieces in the process
or not. That is the world outlook—fashioned by the
“people’s representative” class and by academic riff-raff
from professor to priest—by which the lower orders of
society are demoralized in order that they may be mobilized
in the interests of the leaders’ hatred and thirst for
power. For this reason Socialists of higher quality and conservative
ways of thinking, like Lassalle, supporter of monarchy,
and Georges Sorel, who looked upon the defence of
fatherland, family, and property as the noblest task of the
proletariat (and of whom Mussolini has said that he owes
more to him than to Nietzsche) are difficult to reconcile

Among the many sorts of theoretical Socialism or Communism 
it is, of course, the lowest, and in its ultimate intentions 
the most dishonest, that has won the day; the one 
which has been most ruthlessly directed towards acquiring 
power over the masses for the professional revolutionaries. 
We may call it Marxism or not as we please. It is equally 
unimportant which theory supplies the catchwords for 
propaganda or behind which non-revolutionary world-outlook 
it conceals itself. The practical thought and intention 
is all that matters. He who is vulgar thinks, feels, and 
acts vulgarly and will not be changed by donning priestly 
robes or waving national flags. Whoever founds or leads 
trade unions or Labour parties anywhere in the world 
today is almost of necessity bound to succumb very 
quickly to the Marxist ideology, which slanders and persecutes 
all political and economic leadership, the social 
order, authority and property, under the collective concept 
of Capitalism. He will at once find among his followers the 
now traditional conception of the economic system as class 
war, and will be forced to depend upon it if he wishes to 
remain a leader. Once for all, proletarian egoism, with its 
aims and methods, is the form in which the “White” Revolution

a Socialist movement and whether its leaders insist on 
being Christians or not. The floraison of world-improvement 
theories fills the first ascending century of Rationalism 
from the Contrat social (1762) to the Communist 
Manifesto (1848).¹ In those days men believed, like Soc-
rates and the Sophists, in omniscience of human reason 
and its ability to control destinies and instincts and to order 
and direct historical life. Even in the Linnaean system the 
human being took rank as homo sapiens. The beast in man, 
which gave a forceful reminder of its existence in 1792, 
was forgotten. Never were people further removed from 
the scepticism of the true judge of history and the wise man 
who in all ages knows that “man is wicked from his youth 
up.” It was thought that the nations could be organized ac-
cording to doctrinaire programs with a view to their ulti-
mate bliss, and at any rate the readers of these materialistic 
Utopias believed in them — though how far the writers 
did is another matter. 

¹ The leader of the Catholic Miners’ union said, speaking at Essen on 
the 18th January 1925: “Social ideas establish themselves either by way 
of reform or by way of force. This is not intended as a threat, but as an 
established fact, and if a revolution does come again, I do not think that the 
heads of the German business leaders will be saved.” The Catholic unions 
have repeatedly, with the applause of the “atheistic” ones, demanded the 
expropriation of mining property and industrial establishments at today’s 
valuation — that is, without compensation. This is the expropriation of the 
expropriators of the Communist Manifesto (cf. the pamphlet: Christentum 
Oder Klassenkampf? by F. Holtermann, Berlin). The growing discontent of 
the worthier section of the clergy against the priestly elements which helped 
to develop Catholic Bolshevism and drive it into an alliance with Social 
Democracy, is so great and has spread so extensively from them to the 
peasantry and middle classes that the formation of a German National 
Church — such as the famous Vicar-General of the bishopric of Konstanz, 
von Wessenberg, tried to establish at the time of the Vienna Congress — is 
not beyond the bounds of possibility.

But after 1848 all this came to an end. One of the 
reasons why the Marxian system became the most effective 
was that it was the last. Anyone who today draws up political 
or economic programs for the salvation of “ mankind ” 
is out of date and tiresome. He is near to becoming ridiculous. 
But the upsetting effect of such theories on blockheads 
— who in Lenin’s estimation amount to ninety-five per cent 
of all humanity — is still very great (and is actually on 
the increase in England and America), except in Moscow, 
where there is only a pretence, for political purposes, of 
believing in it. 

The classic “ political economy ” of 1770 and the 
equally old materialistic, or “ economic,” conception of 
history, both of which deduce the destinies of millennia 
from the concepts of “ market,” “ price,” “ goods,” belong 
fundamentally to this same category. They are inwardly 
related, in many ways identical, and lead inevitably to 
dreams of a Third Empire such as the nineteenth-century 
faith in “ progress ” looked for as in some way the end of 
history. It was the materialistic travesty of the conceptions 
of a Third Kingdom held by great Gothic Christians like 
Joachim de Floris.^ It was to establish perfect bliss on 
earth, the fool’s paradise of all the poor and wretched, who 
more and more came to be identified with “ the worker.” 
It was to bring with it the end of anxiety, the dolce far 
niente, and eternal peace; and the road to it was to be made 
by class war and the abolition of property, the breaking 
down of interest-slavery. State Socialism, and the destruction

tion of all masters and plutocrats. It was triumphant class 
egoism, labelled “ welfare of mankind ” and raised morally 
to heaven. 

The ideal of the class war ^ appears first in 1789 in the 
famous propaganda pamphlet of Abbe Sieyes — again a 
Catholic priest! — on the Third Estate, which was to level 
the two above it. From this young-revolutionary Liberal 
form it developed logically into the Bolshevist late form of 
1848, which transferred the struggle from the political to 
the economic domain, not for the sake of economic life, but 
for the purpose of securing political aims by its destruction. 
If “ middle-class ” ideologists discover any difference 
between idealism and materialism in this connexion, 
they must be unable to see through the foreground of catch-
words into the depths of the ultimate aims, which in the 
one and the other case are absolutely the same. All class-
war theories have been drawn up with the object of mobilizing 
the masses of the large cities. The “ class ” which could 
be used for fighting had first to be created. The aim was 
described in 1848, when the first experience of revolutions 
lay well behind, as the dictatorship of the proletariat, but 
that first experience might equally have been called the dictatorship 
of the bourgeoisie — for that is all that Liberalism 
sets out to be. It is the ultimate meaning of constitutions,

and the demagogues’ intention was in part, by the aid of a 
systematically demoralized mob, to annihilate nations out

of pure revenge and in part to gratify their thirst for power 
by enslaving them. 

Every ideal is born of someone who has need of it. The 
ideal of the Liberal, as of the Bolshevist, class war was 
created by people who had either striven unsuccessfully to 
gain admittance to a higher class of society than their own 
or found themselves in one to whose ethical standard they 
could not rise. Marx is a “failed bourgeois,” hence his 
hatred of the bourgeoisie. And the same applies to all the 
other lawyers, writers, professors, and priests: they had 
chosen a profession to which they were not called. This is 
the moral premise of professional revolution. 

The ideal of class war is, as we all know, an overthrow. 
Not the construction of anything new, but the destruction of 
what exists. It is an aim without a future. It is the will-to-
nothing. Utopian programs are designed only for the spiritual 
bribery of the masses. The only serious intention is in 
the object of the bribery, the creation of class as a fighting 
force by means of systematic demoralization. Nothing is a 
better welder than hate. We ought, though, to speak of class 
envy rather than class hatred. For in hatred there is a silent 
acknowledgment of the opponent, while envy is the crooked 
glance from below up to something higher, which remains 
uncomprehended and unattainable and must therefore be 
pulled off its perch, sullied and despised. The vision of the 
proletarian future, therefore, embraces not only the happiness 
of the many,¹ which consists in happily doing nothing

derives from the English materialists of the eighteenth century, among whom 
were devout theologians of the stamp of Paley and Butler. It developed

— once more, panem et circenses — and perpetual peace
in which to enjoy it, free from all anxiety and responsibility;
but also, and primarily, with typical revolutionary bad
taste, the opportunity of gloating over the unhappiness of
the few, of the once mighty, the wise, the aristocratic, and
the rich.^ Every revolution proves it. It is only half the fun
for the lackeys of yesterday to gorge at their masters’ table;
their masters must also wait upon them.

The target of class war, which about 1789 had been waged
against “tyrants” (kings, squires, parsons), began about
1850 — for by that time the political struggle had been
transferred to the economic sphere — to be “Capitalism.”
It is hopeless to try to define this catchword — for such it
is. It is no product of economic experience, but is meant to
have a moral, not to say semi-Christian implication.^ It is
intended to express the essence of economic evil, the great
sin of superiority, the devil disguised as economic success.
In certain middle-class circles it has even become a term of
abuse for everyone who is disliked, every person of rank,
successful entrepreneurs and tradesmen as well as judges,
officers, and scientists, or even peasants. It denotes everyone
who is not a “worker” or labour leader, everyone who
has not failed through inferior ability. For all malcontents,

logically into the Bolshevist formula of the reign of the proletarian masses.
There is no longer any talk of innate differences of rank. Only quantity
matters, quantity of happiness and of happy people. Qualities do not count.

^ This too is an ideal of Christian theology, which counts it among the
joys of paradise that one may watch the tortures of the damned: “Beati in
regno coelesti videbunt poenas damnatorum, ut beatitudo illis magis com-
placeat,” — Thomas Aquinas.

for the spiritual mob, it serves as one comprehensive label 
for those who are strong and sound. 

“ Capitalism ” is in no sense a form of economy or a 
“ bourgeois ” method of making money. It is a way of looking 
at things. There are economists who have discovered 
it in the time of Charlemagne and in the most primitive 
villages. Since 1770 economists have regarded the economic 
system, which is really one side of a nation’s historical 
existence, from the standpoint of the English merchant.^ 
The English nation was at that time engaged in monopolizing 
world commerce. Hence its reputation as a “ nation of 
shopkeepers.” But the merchant is only a middleman. The 
existence of economic life is a premiss of his own activity 
in making himself the centre of gravity around which others, 
in the role of producers and consumers, revolve. This position 
of power is what Adam Smith describes, his “ science.” 
And that is why economics to this day starts from the viewpoint 
of prices and envisages goods and markets instead 
of economic life and active human beings. And this is why, 
henceforth, and especially since the rise of Socialist theory, 
labour also counts as goods, and wages as its price. In a 
system of this sort there is no room either for the work of 
the higher executive and inventor or for that of the peasant. 
All one sees is manufactured goods — and oats or pigs. It 
will not be long before peasants and craftsmen have been 
quite forgotten and the division of mankind into categories

Sombart (Der moderne Kapitalismus, 1919, I, p. 319) describes the purport 
of every economic system as being organization for economic traffic.

will — as with Marx — result in two only: the wage-earner 
and the others, the “exploiters.” 

Thus arose the artificial division of “humanity” into the 
two classes, producers and purchasers,^ which in the hands 
of class-war theorists are falsely contrasted as capitalists 
and proletarians, bourgeoisie and labour, exploiters and 
exploited. Of the trader, however, the real capitalist, one 
hears nothing. The manufacturer or the farmer is the visible 
enemy, because he accepts hired labour and pays wages. 
The notion is senseless, but effective. The stupidity of a 
theory has never prevented its being effectively used. Criticism 
appertains to the author of a system — the believer is 
invariably uncritical. 

“Capitalism” and “Socialism” are both of an age, 
intimately related, produced by the same outlook and burdened 
with the same tendencies. Socialism is nothing but the 
capitalism of the lower classes.* The Manchester Free Trade 
doctrine of Cobden and the Communist system of Marx 
were both born in 1840 and in England. Marx even welcomed 
free-trade Capitalism.* 


^ Sombart says in the same passage: “Capitalism is an organisation for 
economic traffic in which invariably two different groups of the population, 
bound together by the market, co-operate: the owners of the means of pro-
duction, who also control them (economic subjects), and the mere workers 
(economic objects).” But this, though “Liberal,” is already half-way to 
Marx. It applies neither to the peasants nor to craftsmen. 

* What I described in Preussentum und Sozialismus, and what has almost 
always been misunderstood, was Socialism as an ethical attitude, not as a 
materialistic, economic principle.

is conservative, whereas the Free Trade system has a destructive effect. It 
destroys the former nationalities and renders the contrast between proletariat

“ Capitalism from below ” wishes to sell its goods —
namely, paid labour — at as high a price as possible, without
regard to the purchasing power of the buyer, and to
supply as little as possible. Hence the hatred of Socialist
parties for quality-work and piece-work and their efforts
to do away where possible with the “ aristocratic ” distinc-
tion between the payment of skilled and unskilled labour.
They wish to force up the price of manual work by means of
strikes — the first general strike took place in England in
1841 ^ — and, finally, by expropriating the factories and
mines, to place the fixing of wages in the hands of the
bureaucracy of the labour leaders, who at this stage will
be in control of the State. For that is the under-meaning of
State ownership. “ Capitalism from below ” describes the
property that talented and superior people have worked to
acquire as “ stolen,” in order to get enough fists clenched
for it to be appropriated without work. This, then, is the
origin of the class-war theory, economically constructed
with a view to the worker’s vote and politically designed
for the benefit of the labour leader. It was a short-range
aim. Inferior minds can see no further than the morrow in
their outlook on the future, and they act accordingly. Class
war was meant to bring destruction and nothing else. It

and bourgeoisie more acute. In a word, the Free Trade system is precipitating
the social revolution. And only in this revolutionary sense do I vote for
Free Trade.” — (Appendix to Elend der Philosophie.)

¹ That the Marxian strike has, however, no economic aims, but a political
purpose, becomes evident to most people only through the experience of
a general strike. German Socialists have often enough said that it is the lost
strikes rather than the successful ones which are of interest to the party;
they stoke the fires of hate and weld the “ class ” closer together,

was to clear away the forces of tradition, both political and 
economic, to give scope to the revenge and dominion of the 
forces of the underworld. What lies in store beyond that 
victory, when class war has long passed away, no one in 
these circles has troubled to inquire. 

Thus after 1840 the real and infinitely complicated economic 
life of the white nations was subjected to annihilating 
attack from two sides. Attack from above, by the league 
of financiers and speculators, “high finance,” pervaded it 
with its bonds and credits and boards of directors, making 
the administrative work of professional entrepreneurs 
(among whom were numerous former employees who had 
worked their way up by their industry and talent) dependent 
upon its intentions and interests. The actual economic employer 
sank to being the slave of the financier. He might be 
working for the success of a factory while it was being 
ruined by a gamble on the stock exchange of which he knew 
nothing.1 Attack from below, by the unions fashioned by 
the labour leaders, which set to work slowly but surely to 
destroy the economic organism. The theoretical weapon of 
the one is the scientific “Liberal” economics, which forms 
public opinion on economic questions and brings its arguments 
and decisions to bear on legislation; the weapon of 
the other is the Communist Manifesto, the principles of 
which are likewise used to influence the legislature by the 
“Left” of all parliaments. And both represent the principle 
of the “International,” which is purely Nihilistic and 
negative. It is directed against the bounds set by the historical.1

political forms — and every form, every structure, is a setting
of bounds — of the nation, the State, and the national
economies whose sum is world economy. All these stand
in the way of both high finance and professional revolutionaries.
Therefore they are repudiated and marked for
destruction.

But both types of theory are now out of date. All that
could be said has long been said, and both theories have
been so thoroughly discredited since 1918 by their prophecies,
whether concerning New York or Moscow, that although
they continue to be quoted, no one believes in them.
The world revolution began under the shadow of them. It
has perhaps reached its height today, but is far from being
at an end, for it is assuming forms that are free from all
theoretical twaddle.

And now at last it is possible to record the “ successes ”
which the World Revolution has achieved. For the Revolution
has reached its goal. It no longer menaces, it triumphs.
It has won. And if its supporters argue the contrary to
others or to their own horrified consciences, this is but one
more case of the fate that eternally in human history pursues
the fighter — the realization, with cruel distinctness,
that the goal reached is quite different from that
aimed at, and, in most crises, that it was not worth the
trouble.

The success this time is enormous. It is for all white
nations so terrifying that no one sees, or dares to see, all
its implications; the originators have not the courage to

acknowledge it as their work, neither has the remnant of 
“society,” as it survives among the middle classes, the 
courage to confront them with the fact. The first part of the 
way from Liberalism to Bolshevism was traversed in fighting 
against the political forces. Today these are destroyed, 
devoured, crushed. Once more, as in the Rome of the 
Gracchi, we are shown that everything that the few big and 
strong beasts of prey, the statesmen and conquerors, have 
created through the centuries can be gnawed away in a short 
time by the mass of small animals, the human vermin. The 
old and honourable forms of the State lie in ruins. They 
have been replaced by formless parliamentarism, a dust-heap 
of what was once authority, art of governing and wisdom of 
State. And on it the parties, those hordes of business-politicians, 
scramble for the booty. Dynastic sovereignty 
has been replaced by election that each time brings new 
hordes of the unfit into State affairs. 

And among these parties it is everywhere Labour and its 
trade unions (pursuing political aims with economic means, 
and economic aims with political means), with their pooling 
of leader-material programs and methods of agitation, 
that have set the fashion for all. All seek to win over the 
masses of the great cities, pelt them with the same senseless 
hopes, and whip them on with the same accusations. Hardly 
a party now dares to suggest that it represents any other 
sections of the nation but the “worker.” Whether from 
cowardice or from hope of successes at the poll, they treat 
him almost without exception as a privileged class. In all 
countries they have succeeded in demoralizing him, turning

him into a most exacting, discontented, and therefore unhappy 
creature, putting him in the melting-pot with the 
rabble of the streets to produce a like-minded unit, a 
“ class,” to breed from him the type of the proletarian in 
spirit — which by the mere fact of its existence guarantees 
revolutionary success, which despises industriousness and 
achievement as a betrayal of the “ cause,” and whose highest 
ambition it is to become a leader of the masses and pillar 
of the Revolution, 

It makes no difference whether these class-war fronts 
have taken the form of bureaucratic parties or trade unions, 
such as the Marxian, Catholic, and National unions in 
Germany and similar ones in England ; whether they have 
the Latin form of anarchist and Socialist clubs as in Barcelona 
and Chicago, or whether they exist, as once in Russia 
and now in America, in underground movements and 
only rally visibly at the moment of action. One and all they 
consist of controlling groups of professional demagogues 
and a sheeplike following which has to serve the scarcely 
comprehended ultimate aim and be sacrificed to it. The 
governments have long ago become their executives, either 
because the mass-leaders themselves possess the parliamentary 
power or because their opponents, hypnotized by the 
“ worker” ideology, lack courage to think and act for 
themselves. 

They reign supreme in economics also, in this case using 
political means for a political object. And this object has 
never been lost sight of: class war against the organic forces 
and forms of economic life known as Capitalism. Since

1848 the ultimate aim is its annihilation, and this has now 
been achieved. The world-economic crisis of this year and 
a good many next years is not, as the whole world supposes, 
the temporary consequence of war, revolution, inflation, 
and payment of debts. It has been willed. In all essentials 
it is the product of the deliberate work of the leaders of the 
proletariat. Its roots lie far deeper than is thought. Its effects 
are only to be overcome in long, hard battles against everything 
that is popular today, and much of this can never 
now be undone. Courage to see what is actually happening 
would be the initial requirement, and I fear that the stock 
of this is very low. At no time has the whole world shown 
such cowardice before the general opinion of parliaments, 
parties, speakers, and writers. They are all on their knees 
before the “ people,” the masses, the proletariat, or whatever 
they may call that which blindly and unsuspectingly 
serves as weapon for the leaders of the World Revolution. 
The reproach of being “ the enemy of the worker ” causes 
every politician to blanch. 

But who, then, really won the World War? Certainly 
not any State, neither France nor England nor America. 
Nor white “ Labour,” though it did to a great extent pay 
for it: first with its blood on the field, then with its standard 
of life in the economic crisis. It was the noblest victim of 
its leaders. It was ruined for their ends. The labour leader 
won the War. That which in every country is called the 
Labour party and the trade union, but is in reality the trade 
union of party officials, the bureaucracy of the Revolution, 
gained the mastery and is now ruling over Western Civilization-

tion. It has driven the proletariat from strike to strike, from
street-fight to street-fight and has itself proceeded from one
devastating parliamentary resolution to another, either
in virtue of its own power or because of the terror of the
beaten middle classes. The governments, everywhere in the
world, have since 1916 become more and more rapidly
dependent on them and are obliged to obey their orders if
they do not wish to be overthrown. These brutish inroads
into the structure and meaning of economic life they must
either allow to be made or make them themselves. Such
attacks are wholly in the interests of the lowest grade of
labour, the merest “hands,” and take the form of extravagant
raising of wages and reduction of working hours, of
devastating taxes on the profits of management, on old
family property, on industry, and on the peasantry. The
sack of society has been accomplished. It was the reward
of the mercenaries in the class war. The natural centre of
gravity of the economic body, the economic judgment of
the real experts, was replaced by an artificial, non-expert,
party-political one. The equilibrium was destroyed and the
structure collapsed. But this had for decades been the
openly avowed intention of Western Bolshevism, and so
economic catastrophe was a tactical victory, little as Labour
had suspected or intended it. This overthrow of capitalism,
prefigured ever since 1848 and enthusiastically lauded by
Bebel, this “Last Judgment” on the bourgeoisie, ought,
it is true, to have automatically brought about the longed-for
dictatorship of the proletariat (that is, of its creators
and leaders).

It has not done so, we think — and yet, has it not? Quite 
apart from Moscow, what but this was the trade-union Republic 
in Germany? Is not economic, bureaucratically administered 
Socialism the reigning ideal in the national 
Labour parties of Germany, England, and even Italy? Have 
not the men with creative economic ideas, the promoters of 
private economic enterprise, been sacrificed to this dictatorship 
on the platform of the world-economic ruin? The 
economic leader, the expert in economic life, has been 
ousted by the party leader, who, if he know nothing of 
economics, knows all there is to know about demagogic 
propaganda. He rules as a bureaucrat in the drafting of 
economic legislation, which has displaced the free decisions 
of the man who knows, as leading spirit in countless 
committees, courts of arbitration, conferences, cabinet meetings 
and whatever the forms of his dictatorship may call 
themselves, and even in the Fascist ministry of Corporations. 
He is out for State Socialism, for the elimination 
of private initiative, for economic “ planning ” — all of 
which mean the same thing: Communism. No matter if the 
“ worker ” be sacrificed with the “ boss,” the professional 
“ labour leader ” has at last the desired power in his hands 
and is able to avenge the underworld against those who, by 
the accident of birth which endowed them with talents and 
natural superiority, were called to see things from above 
and to govern.

deliberate working to that end. But so it is; there is proof 
of it. The process began as soon as the professional revolutionaries 
of Marx’s generation had realized that, in North-
West Europe, the dependence of industry on coal had become 
the vital factor of economic life. The bare existence 
of the growing masses of the nations depended on its flourishing. 
As regards England, this was already the case; as 
to Germany they were hopeful, and the doctrinaires who 
viewed the world diagrammatically as bourgeoisie and proletariat 
assumed as a matter of course that the same development 
must take place everywhere. But how did it 
stand with Spain and Italy, which had no coal? Or even 
with France, not to mention Russia? 1 It is amazing how 
narrow the horizon of these theologians of the class war 
was and remained, and how little this has been realized 
until our day. Did they ever include Africa, Asia, or Latin 
America in the sphere of their economic researches and 
prophecies? Did they waste one thought on the coloured 
workers of tropical colonies? Were they aware that these 
were omitted and why they had to be omitted? They talked 
of the future of “humanity,” and instead of taking the 
whole planet into their field of vision they stared fixedly at 

1 In the preface to the second Russian edition of the Communist Manifesto 
(1882) Marx and Engels set up a theory of evolution which entirely 
contradicts that expressed in Capital. Here the road to definitive Communism 
is, all at once, to run by way of the reputed village Communism of the 
peasants, the mir, instead of through an absolute domination of the bourgeoisie. 
There was in Russia neither bourgeoisie nor proletariat in the Western 
European sense, and the two demagogues therefore adapted their “conviction” 
to the masses whom they wished to mobilize against the Petrine 
State. The labour leaders of Moscow, on the contrary, proceeded, in the 
interests of the Western “truth,” to fight the peasants for the sake of a 
working class which hardly existed.

a few European countries, whose State and society they intended
to destroy.

In the case of these, however, they saw that this would
be possible if they paralysed the vitality of industry, and
the systematic attack upon it began with the attempt to
make its organized working impossible. This was done in
the first place by forcibly reducing the daily hours of wage-
earners in factories (at first in them only) in contrast to the
higher work of executives, inventors and engineers.¹

In the eighteenth century the working day amounted to
more than twelve hours, though without being legally fixed,
this being the usual practice among Nordic peasants and
artisans. At the beginning of the nineteenth century it was
limited in England to twelve hours, and about 1850 was
again reduced by the Ten-Hour Bill, which incidentally
was fiercely opposed by the workers themselves.² When
the bill was finally passed, it was acclaimed in revolutionary
circles as a victory for the working class and, rightly, as the
crippling of industry. The blow, it was believed, would be
fatal. From that time the trade unions of all countries
undertook to exert increasing pressure to reduce the working
day still more and to extend the rule to all wage-earners.

¹ This intellectual work can never be limited to a definite number of
hours. It pursues and tyrannises over its victims during their periods of rest,
on their travels, and in their sleepless nights. It makes a real rest from
thought and real relaxation impossible and uses up the most able men of
the time. No worker for wages breaks down from overstrain or mental collapse.
But among these others it happens in innumerable cases. So much
for the demagogues’ picture of the gourmandizing, idle bourgeois!

² Because they did not wish to be prevented from making full use of
their working power, as every tailor might do. This healthy instinct still
forces its way up, in spite of all Labour agitations, as is seen in the desire
for overtime work and subsidiary occupations.

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

Towards the end of the century the limit was nine hours, 
and at the end of the World War eight hours. Today, as we 
approach the middle of the twentieth century, the forty-hour 
week is the minimum of the revolutionary demand. 
Since at the same time the ban on Sunday work is more 
strictly enforced, the individual worker delivers only half 
of the original, possible, and natural quantum of what he 
has to sell — namely, labour. And thus the “worker,” who 
according to the Marxian doctrine is the only one who 
works, has become, to a great extent unwillingly, the one 
who works the least. What profession would tolerate so 
slight an output? 

This was the fighting method of the strike in a disguised, 
slowly penetrating form. It first took on meaning through 
the fact that the price for this form of goods, the weekly 
wage, was not only not reduced, but was forced steadily 
upward. Now, the “value,” the actual product of the work 
done, is not an independent quantity. It is a result obtained 
from the organic whole of industrial labour, in which the 
administrative work of controlling and regulating operations, 
the obtaining of materials, the marketing of products, 
the thinking out of costs and yield, of lay-out and equipment, 
and of new possibilities, are of far greater importance. 
The total output depends upon the order and amount 
of head-work, not hand-work, that is put into it. If there is 
no yield, if the product is unsalable, then the work put into 
the process has been valueless and ought really not to be 
paid for at all. This is what happens to the peasant and the 
craftsman. But through the activities of the trade unions

THE HOUR OF WORLD-REVOLUTION

the hourly wage of the handworker has been removed from
the unit of the organism. It is settled by the party leader,
not by the economic leader, and if the latter does not and
cannot consent to it, it is enforced by strikes, sabotage, and
pressure on parliament. In the last hundred years it has
risen by a great deal in proportion to the earnings of peasants
and craftsmen. Everyone actively employed in the
economic system is dependent for his gain on the economic
situation — everybody except the wage-earning workman.
He has a claim to the wage-level that is fixed inorganically
and fought for by party-political means, even when it can
only be maintained by allowing works to fall into decay,
cutting out profits altogether, and selling goods at less than
cost price — until the factories themselves give in, and a
malicious feeling of triumph runs through the ranks of the
labour leaders who have once more won a victory on the
road to their eventual goal.

Today, when the birth of the class-war theory is nearly a
hundred years behind us and no one any longer really believes
in it, it seems doubtful whether these leaders are
still conscious of the end for which all this work of destruction
was originally designed and started. There is, however,
a tradition and method which over long years has grown
up among them, by which they are bound to work unceasingly
for reduction of work and increase of wages. It is this
which proves their ability in the eyes of the Party. And if
today the original dogmatic meaning is forgotten and the
good conscience of the believer is lacking, the effect is still
there, though it may be traced back to other causes: a new

means of agitation, the finding of a new sin against the 
working class which may be fathered upon Capitalism. 

Once the doctrine of “ surplus value ” had power to 
sway the undeveloped reasoning of the masses; the whole 
output of industrial production was equal to the value of 
executive manual labour and had to be allotted accordingly. 
What the manufacturer deducted from it — for upkeep of 
the works, payment for raw materials, salaries, interest: 
the “ surplus value,” in fact — was robbery. The administration, 
the inventors, the engineers, all did no work whatever; 
and if they had done, mental work such as theirs, 
which was a kind of doing nothing, had no real value. It 
was the same “democratic” tendency which scorned and 
would have destroyed quality of any sort, and thought only 
in terms of quantity, even in manual work. The “aristocratic” 
distinction between skilled and unskilled labour 
had to be abolished. Both should receive equal payment. 
Piece-work and superior production were branded as 
betrayal of the cause. This attitude has triumphed, and post-war 
Germany in particular is its triumph. It has eliminated 
competition among the workers, stifled the impulse to attain 
higher levels of skill, and thereby reduced the total output. 
That all this was Nihilism, the will-to-destruction, we see

situation of 1840 was re-entablished in every respect as 
soon as “ the goal ” had been realized; long working hours, 
low wages; the widest possible gulf — wider even than in 
America — between the payment of skilled and of unskilled 
work, and the importation of foreign engineers to

replace their own — who had been killed off, as, according
to the doctrine of the Communist Manifesto, they merely
exploited the worker without doing anything: their worth
was not realized until later.

The idea that the worker had a right to the “full value”
of his work, which was equated with the total yield of the
undertaking, persisted until the end of the century. This at
least set a natural limit for the wage-demands. But side by
side with and out of it arose, from about the seventies onward,
the far from theoretical method of forcing up wages
by the political pressure of the workers’ organizations. It
was no longer a question of the limits fixed by the economic
system to this exploitation in favour of the one class, but
only of the limits of political, parliamentary, revolutionary
power. In almost all “white” countries, about the turn of
the century and in Germany most conspicuously after 1918,
there existed, side by side with the constitutional Government
a subsidiary one consisting of trade unions of every
variety. Its task was primarily to feed the electorate with
wages and purchase the right to do so from the “bourgeois”
powers by granting them permission to govern. The
“working-class vote,” handled as such by all party leaders,
had become the decisive factor for everything to which
parliaments dared to commit themselves. Thus the political
wage, for which there were no longer any natural, economic
limits, became an established fact. The wage-tariffs, which
the State was bound to support, were fixed by the party, not
calculated economically, and the high tariff of trade unions
became a right which no bourgeois party or government

dared to touch or call in question. The political wage soon
outdistanced the “full value” of the work. It drove industry
in the “white” countries to desperate measures of self-
help and self-preservation and so landed it in the tangled
situation of which the result is in the world-economic catastrophe
now before us. Wage-Bolshevism, working through
strikes, sabotage, elections, and government crises, drained
so much blood from the economic life of nations — not
Germany’s alone — that fevered efforts had to be made to
make good these losses by every imaginable device.

We must realize how comprehensive is the term “political
wage” before we can estimate the pressure of this wage-
dictatorship on the economic life of nations. Reaching out
far beyond money payment, it embraces concern for the
worker’s whole existence, the burden of which is taken
from him to be loaded on to “the rest.” “The worker” has
become a pensioner of society and of the nation. Every
human being has, like every animal, to defend himself
against the incalculable workings of destiny — or to submit
to them. Each has his own personal cares, full responsibility
for himself, and must inevitably make his own decisions
in all dangers threatening himself and his aims. No
one dreams of relieving, at the expense of others, farmers
from the consequences of bad harvests, cattle disease, fire,
and failing markets; or artisans, doctors, engineers, tradespeople,
and scientists from the threat of economic ruin and
unfitness for work owing to insufficient qualifications, sickness,
or accident. Each of these has to deal with such things
himself and at his own expense or else bear the conse-

consequences and beg or go under in any other way he pleases. 
Such is life. The craving to insure oneself, against old age, 
accident, sickness, unemployment — in short, against fate 
in every conceivable form — which is a sign of sinking 
vitality, beginning from Germany has now embedded itself 
in one way and another in the mentality of all “white” 
nations. The victim of misfortune cries out to others without 
any will to help himself. But there is a difference which 
denotes the victory of Marxian thought over the original 
Germanic, individualist instincts of delight in responsibility 
and of the personal struggle with fate, the amor fati. All the 
rest in seeking to evade or to meet the unforeseen do so according 
to their own resolve and in their own strength; it is 
only the “worker” who is spared this decision. He alone 
can rest assured that others will think and act for him. The 
degenerating effect of this freedom from all responsibility, 
which is seen similarly in children of very rich parents, 
has overtaken the whole working class, especially in Germany: 
at the first sign of any distress, appeal for help is 
made to the State, the party, society, or, in any case, 
“others.” We have forgotten how to take decisions ourselves 
and to live under the stress of real anxiety. 

But this means a further burden laid on the higher work 
in the community for the benefit of the lower. For this part 
of the political wage also — insurance of every kind¹ 

¹ The result is the preposterous importance attaching to minor anxieties 
— the “problems” of fashion or of cooking, of married or unmarried lovers’ 
quarrels, and, above all, of boredom, which leads to weariness of living. 
Vegetarianism becomes a sport, and erotic taste a “world outlook.” One 
commits suicide if one cannot have the desired evening frock or lover, or 
because one cannot agree about a dinner or an outing.

against fate, the building of workers’ dwellings (no one
thinks of demanding these for farm labourers), the
construction of playgrounds, convalescent homes, libraries,
and the special terms for food, railway journeys, and
amusements — is all paid for directly or indirectly by
taxation of the rest—for the working man. This in fact
is an essential part of the political wage, and it receives
very little thought. At the same time the national wealth of
which we are given the amount in figures is an economic
fiction. It is calculated — as “capital” — from the yield
of economic undertakings or from the market prices of
interest-bearing shares, and it falls with these when the
value of the working factories is threatened by the burden
of high wages. A factory that is thus made to close down is,
however, of no more value except for the scrap-heap. Under
the dictatorship of the trade unions, Germany’s economic
system had in the four years 1925-9 to meet an extra load
of 18,225,000,000 marks annually in respect of increased
wages, taxes, and grants for social purposes.1 This means
one-third of the national income spent one-sidedly. One
year later the sum had grown to far beyond twenty milliard
marks. What are two milliards for reparations compared
with this? It endangered the financial position of the Reich
and the currency. Its drag on the economic system was not
even taken into account when the effects of wage-Bolshevism
were in question. It was the expropriation of the whole economic
system in the interests of one class.

There is higher work, and lower: nothing can deny or 
alter this truth. It is the expression of the fact that Culture 
exists. The higher the stage of development in a Culture, 
the more powerful its creative force, the greater the difference 
between determining and subordinate actions of all 
kinds; whether political, economic, or artistic. For Culture 
is ordered, intellectualized life, a maturing and self-perfecting 
form, which calls for an ever higher grade of personality. 
There is work for which one must have an inner 
call, and other work that one must do, because one can do 
nothing better to earn a living. There is work for which 
only a very few men of superior rank are competent, and 
other work which is valuable only in terms of duration and 
volume. Whichever it is, one is born to it. That is fate. It 
cannot be altered either by Rationalist or by sentimental-romantic 
equality-talk. 

The global output of work for which the Western Culture 
is responsible, which is identical with it, becomes 
greater every century. At the time of the Reformation it 
amounted to many times what it had been in the age of the 
Crusades, and it grew to immense size in the eighteenth 
century, in response to the dynamism of creative leaders’ 
work, which had of necessity made the demand for the 
lower type of mass labour greater and greater. But it is for 
that very reason that the proletarian revolutionary — who 
sees Culture from below and, not possessing it himself, is 
unable to understand it — seeks to destroy it, to do with-

out “quality” work, or any work even. If there are no
more men having Culture — to his mind they are a luxury
and superfluity — there will be less work, and, above all,
inferior work which anyone can do. I once read in a
Socialist paper that when the money-millionaires have been
abolished, the brain-millionaires must be sent after them.
Real creative work is a vexation to such people. They hate
its superiority and envy its success, whether the result takes
the form of power or of wealth. The charwoman of a
hospital is of more importance to them than the principal
physician; the ploughman is worth more than the farmer
who improves the grain and breeds pedigree cattle, the
stoker more than the inventor of the engine. A transvaluation
of economic values — to use a Nietzschean phrase —
has come about, and as, in the eyes of the masses, any value
translates itself into money, into pay, the lower-grade mass
labour ought to be better paid than the higher work of
outstanding personalities — and this is being brought about.

There have been consequences that no one yet has really
understood. This “white” worker, whom Labour party
leaders and a cowardly middle class vie with each other in
flattering and spoiling, is becoming a luxury animal. Do
let us leave out idiotic comparisons with millionaires who
are “well off” — it is not a question of people who live in
palaces and keep armies of servants. Take a modern
industrial worker’s private cost of living in comparison with that
of a yeoman. About 1840 the mode of living was much the
same for both. Today the former works far less than the
other, but the manner in which the peasant — whether in

Pomerania, Yorkshire, or Kansas — lives, feeds, and 
clothes himself contrasts so pitifully with what a metal 
worker, from the Ruhr area to Pennsylvania, spends on his 
keep and above all on his amusements that the latter would 
immediately strike at the suggestion that he should ever 
again take up this way of life with twice the work, and perpetual 
anxiety over bad harvests, markets, and debts into 
the bargain. That which appears as the minimum for existence 
and is regarded as “poverty” in the great Northern 
cities would seem extravagant in a village an hour’s journey 
away — not to mention the style of living in the area of 
South-European land-Communism, where the simplicity of 
coloured races still exists. But this luxury of the working 
classes is a fact, and who pays for it? Not the work that is 
done. Their output is not worth so much by a long way. It 
is others who have to work, all the rest of the nation, to 
meet it. There are fools — and if Ford was serious in what 
he said and wrote, he is one of them — who believe that 
the workers’ increased purchasing-power will preserve the 
level of economic life. But did those unoccupied masses in 
Rome after the Gracchan period do so? People talk of the 
home market without considering what this really is. Let 
this new dogma of the “white” trade unions be tested: pay 
the worker, not in money, but in the products of his own 
labour: in locomotives, chemicals, and paving-stones, and 
let it be his business to sell them.

He would not know what to do with them. He would be 
horrified to find how little these things are worth. It would

intellectualized taste, is needed for the intelligent spending 
of money as for earning it by superior achievement. Luxury 
can be elegant or vulgar, and no one can alter the fact. It is 
the difference between a Mozart opera and a musical 
comedy, but the luxury wage is definitely not the complement 
of a refined craving for luxurious conditions. It is 
only the purchasing power of a higher rank of society that 
makes quality industry possible. The lower orders merely 
feed an entertainment industry, as in ancient Rome, 

But this vulgar luxury of great cities — little work, much 
money, and still more amusement — exercised a fatal influence 
upon the hard-working and simple men of the open 
country. They learnt to know of needs of which their fathers 
would never have let themselves dream. Self-denial is hard 
when one has the opposite before one. The flight from the 
land set in: first the farm-hands and maids went, then the 
farmers’ sons, and in the end whole families who did not 
know whether or how they could hold the paternal heritage 
in the face of all this distortion of economic life. It has been 
the same in all Cultures at that stage. There is no truth in 
the belief that Italy became depopulated after Hannibal’s 
time by the large landed estates. It was the “panem et circenses” 
of cosmopolitan Rome that did it, and it was only 
when the land had lost its population and become worthless 
that the farming of ^large estates by means of slaves developed.^ Otherwise it would have become a wilderness. 
The depopulation of the villages began in England in 1840, 
in Germany in 1880, in the Middle West of the United

States in 1920. The peasant is tired of working without 
wages when the town offers him wages without work. So 
away he goes — to become a “proletarian.” 

The worker himself was innocent in the matter. He does 
not feel his mode of life to be luxurious; quite the con- 
trary. He became wretched and dissatisfied like every un- 
earning privileged person. That which yesterday was the 
object of extravagant desires has today become a matter of 
course and by tomorrow will be a state of distress calling 
loudly for help. The labour leader spoilt his man when he 
appointed him a praetorian of the class war. At the time of 
the Communist Manifesto he was to be made morally a 
proletarian to this end; now he is encouraged, to the same 
end, to hope that he will one day no longer be one. But in 
the one case as in the other the unjustified level of the po- 
litical wage has led to more and more things becoming 
indispensable. 

But can this wage, which has become an independent 
quantity alongside those of economics, possibly be paid any 
longer? What with? By whom? Close inspection shows that 
the conception of economic profits has undergone an im- 
perceptible change under the pressure of the forcing up of 
wages. Only a healthy economic life can be productive. 
There is a natural, unforced profit as long as the wages in- 
volved in a process are functionally dependent on it. Once 
this becomes an independent, a political, quantity, an un- 
interrupted blood-letting which no living body can stand, 
there begins an artificial, morbid way of estimating eco- 
nomic operation, a race between the market, which must

keep on top if the whole is not to collapse and bleed away, 
and the hurrying advance of wages with the accompanying 
taxes and the social contributions which are indirect taxes. 
The feverish tempo of increasing production comes chiefly 
from this secret wound in the economic life. The incitement 
to buy luxuries is diffused by every form of advertisement; 
the foreign market among coloured peoples is extended 
and imposed by force. The economic imperialism 
of the great industrial states, which uses military means to 
secure market areas and keeps them to their role as such, is 
intensified by the urge to self-preservation of the heads of 
industry, who have to hold their own under the perpetual 
political-wage pressure of Labour. From the moment that 
a real or apparent “ recovery ” of industry occurs in any 
part of the “ white ” world, the trade unions put in new 
wage-claims in order to secure for their followers profits 
which actually are non-existent. In Germany, when the 
reparations payments were suspended, it was at once assumed 
that these “ savings ” must go to benefit the working 
class. The natural result of luxury wages was an increase in 
the cost of production — and correspondingly a fall in the 
value of money — and here, too, there was political intervention, 
in that selling-prices were maintained or lowered 
by statute to secure the purchasing-power of the wages. 
Thus, the repeal of the Corn Laws in England about 1850 
was a disguised form of wage-increase. Its effect was to 
sacrifice the agricultural labourer to the industrial worker, 
and since then this has been attempted or actually carried 
out everywhere, owing in part to the absurd economic pro-

announcement of bankers and other “experts” that the world
should be divided into agrarian and industrial countries in
order to obtain a practicable organization of “world
economy.” What, in these circumstances, was to become of
the peasant class in industrial countries no one inquired. It
was the mere object in Labour politics, the enemy to the
monopoly interest of Labour. All Labour organizations are
hostile to the land-workers, whether they admit it or contest
it. Similarly the price of coal and iron was fixed under
parliamentary pressure without regard to the cost of extraction,
though this is bound up with these very wages; all
sorts of special prices for the working classes were also
insisted upon, and these had then to be made good by
a rise in the normal prices for “the rest.” If this damaged
or even ruined the market, that was the private
affair of the entrepreneurs, and the more their position
was shaken, the more triumphant the trade unions felt
themselves.

One result of the effects of this class war was the increasing
need of productive industry for “credit,” for
“capital” — that is to say, for imaginary money values,
which are there only as long as one believes in their existence
and when the least doubt arises dissolve into nothingness
in the form of a crash on the stock exchange. It was a
despairing attempt to replace the lost real values by phantom
values. The hey-day of a new and wily banking method
had set in, by which enterprises were financed and at the
same time controlled by the banks, which not only gave
credit, but created it on paper, a ghostlike, homeless, and

airy finance-capital. Old family properties have been more
and more rapidly converted into joint-stock companies,
made fluid, so that the money thus raised might fill the gaps
in the circulation of expenditure and receipts. The indebtedness
of productive industry — for shares are at bottom
nothing but a debt — grew to fabulous proportions, and
when the necessity of paying interest on it, as well as wages,
began to look threatening for the latter, the final weapon
of the class war was brought out: the demand for expropriation
of the works by the State. By this means wages are
to be definitely withdrawn from the economic balance-sheet
and regarded as State salaries, which will be fixed
by the governing Labour parties at will and for which the
means of the rest of the nation will be commandeered by
fiscal Bolshevism.

The final, decisive results of this folly of luxury wages
have become increasingly apparent since 1900. The growing
desolation of the agricultural countryside brought ever
greater crowds into the sphere of the panem et circenses
of the cities and tempted industry to enlarge its undertakings — no misgivings as to the disposal of the products
having yet arisen. Between 1900 and 1914 fifteen million
of countryfolk from South and East Europe migrated to
the United States, where the farming population was already
on the decrease.^ In the North of Europe there was
internal migration to the same amount. In the mining area
of Briey, for instance, there were in 1914 more Polish and

^ The pure farming population came to a standstill about 1900, declined
by 100,000 per annum from about 1910 onward, by half a million from 1920,

Italian than French miners. And then Nemesis overtook
this development from a side which the class-war leaders
had never taken into account, and had indeed never
noticed.

Marx both admired and hated the industrial system of
the “white” countries of the North as the masterpiece of
the bourgeoisie. He had eyes only for the home of it in
England, France, and Germany, and his successors accepted
this provincial horizon as the orthodox premiss of
all tactical considerations. But the world was bigger than
that, was something more than an area which meekly and
obediently absorbed the exports of little Northern Europe.
The mass of white workers lived not by industry itself but
by the industrial monopoly of the Northern great powers.
Only on the basis of this fact could the political wage be
paid without leading to immediate catastrophe. But outside
and beyond the class war of the working class with
society within the field of the white nations, a race struggle
of quite other dimensions raised its head; no labour leader
had foreseen it, and no one to this day has realized, or
dared to realize, the fateful relentlessness of its advance.
The competition of white workers among themselves had
been suppressed by trade-union organization and wage-
tariffs. The difference that had grown up since 1840 between
the standard of living of the industrial worker and
the land-worker presented no dangers, as all the politico-
economic rulings—customs, taxes, statutes—were unilateral,
made by the industrial side against the agricultural.
But in the new struggle it was the coloured worker’s

Standard of living which competed with the luxury wage 
of the white working-class. 

Coloured wages are a quantity of a different order and 
different origin from those of the white. They are dictated, 
not demanded, and are kept down if necessary by force 
of arms. This is not called “reaction” or “injustice to 
the proletariat,” but colonial policy; and the English 
worker, at least, has been quite agreeable to it, having 
learnt to think imperially. In demanding the “full” value 
of the proceeds as the workers’ wages, Marx tried to suppress 
one fact which it would have been more honest to 
note and take account of: the proceeds of the Northern 
industries include the cost of tropical raw materials — 
cotton, rubber, metals — and this in turn includes the low 
wages of coloured labor. The overpayment of white labour 
therefore depends upon the underpayment of coloured 
labour.^ 

Soviet Russia prides itself on the tactics of undercutting 
by which it attacks the vitality of the “white” economic 
system: namely, the setting back of its own working-class 
— if necessary by starving them or (as in Moscow in 1923) 
shelling them. But as a matter of fact the method had been 
in process of development for a long time, and without 
any forcing, all over the globe. And it struck with terrific 
effect, not so much on the quality of Western industrialism 
as on the very existence of the white working- 

^ Similarly, the purchasing-power of white wages is increased by the 
fact that the home agriculture has to face the competition of supplies produced 
on coloured wages, while it is itself tied to high scales of wages and 
expense generally.

class. Were the Soviets so dogma-blinded as not to see
this, or were they heralds of the will-to-annihilate of the
Asiatic race-consciousness that is awakening and means to
exterminate the Western Culture-peoples?

In the South African mines, whites and Kaffirs work
side by side: the whites for eight hours at the rate of two
shillings an hour, the Kaffirs for twelve hours at the rate
of one shilling a day. This grotesque disproportion is
maintained by the white trade-unions, which veto any attempt
of the coloured workers to organize themselves and
bring pressure to bear on their political parties to prevent
the ejection of the whites, lock, stock, and barrel, although
this is the obvious course. But this is only one example of
the general situation between white and coloured labour
all the world over. Japanese industry is driving its white
competitors out of the field in every part of Southern and
Eastern Asia by its low wages and has already made its
appearance on the European and American market.^ Indian
textile goods are seen in London. And in the midst of this
a fearful thing is happening. As late as 1880 the only
exploited coal measures lay in Northern Europe and North
America. Now they have been discovered and opened up
in every continent. White Labour’s monopoly of coal has
vanished. And what is even more serious, industry has
freed itself to a very large extent^ from dependence on
coal through water-power, oil, and electrical power-transmission.
It is now free to move about, and it does so. What

It is more, it moves everywhere away from the domain of
white trade-union dictatorships into countries with low
wages. The dispersion of Western industry has been in
full swing since 1900. The mills of India were established
as branches of English factories, with the idea of getting
“nearer the consumer.” Such was the original intention,
but the West-European luxury wage has led to a very
different result. In the United States industry has migrated
more and more from Chicago and New York to the Negro
areas in the South, and it will not halt at the Mexican
frontier. There are growing industrial areas in China, Java,
South Africa, South America. The flight of highly developed
techniques to the colour areas continues, and the
white luxury-wage is beginning to be rather theoretical,
since the work by which it is earned is no longer wanted.

Even by 1900 the danger was immense. The structure
of the “white” economic system was already undermined.
It threatened to break down at the first world-historical
upheaval under the load of the political wage, the reduced
hours of work that men would stand, the saturation of
all foreign markets, and the emergence of foreign industrial
areas which were outside the jurisdiction of white
Labour-parties. Only the unbelievable peace after 1870,
which was diffused over the “white” world by its statesmen’s
dread of making incalculable decisions, maintained
the universal delusion vis-a-vis the catastrophe that was

approaching with sinister speed. The gloomy presages of 
its coming were not noticed or not seriously considered. 
A fateful, shallow, almost criminal optimism — the faith 
in unswerving progress, as expressed in figures — dominated 
the leaders of Labour and of industry alike, not to 
mention the politicians, and found support in the morbid 
inflation of the fictitious finance-capital which all the world 
took to be real property, real and indestructible money 
value. But even by 1910 individual voices had been heard 
recalling that the world was in process of being satiated 
with the products of industry, including those of industrialized 
large-scale farming. Here and there proposals 
were made for an agreement between the powers upon a 
voluntary quota system of production, but there was no 
response. No one believed in any serious dangers. No 
one wanted to believe in them. And in any case the 
premises were unsound, as such propositions came from 
one-sided observers who saw the economic system as an 
independent quantity and not as the expression of something 
far stronger, the policy of the creeping world-revolution 
which had forced economics into wrong forms and 
tendencies. The causes lay too deep to be even touched by 
inquiries into crisis and trade-cycle problems. And it was 
already too late. One more short breathing-space of self-delusion 
was permitted: the preparation for the World 
War, which claimed innumerable hands, or at any rate 
withdrew them from production work, as soldiers of the 
standing armies or as workers in war industries.

it, but merely no longer averted — the economic collapse 
of the white world. It would have come in any case, only 
more slowly and in less appalling forms. But this war was 
waged from the first by England, the home of practical 
Labour-Socialism, for the economic destruction of Germany, 
the youngest great power, the economic unit which 
was developing the most rapidly and on superior lines, 
and for her perpetual exclusion as a competitor in the 
world’s markets. The more completely statesmanlike thinking 
foundered in the chaos of events, leaving only military 
and crude economic tendencies in the field, the more clearly 
everywhere emerged the sombre hope of ruining first Germany, 
then Russia, then the individual powers of the Entente, 
and finally the home industrial and financial position, 
and so of rescuing the home workers from the impossible 
situation. But even that was not the actual beginning of the 
catastrophe that followed, which developed out of the fact 
that, after 1916, the dictatorship of the working classes 
vis-a-vis State government had established itself, openly 
or secretly, in all white countries, whether actively engaged 
in the War or no, and that, although varying greatly in 
form and degree, it followed invariably the same revolutionary 
tendency. It overthrew or controlled all governments. It wormed its way into all armies and navies. It was 
— and rightly — more dreaded than the War itself. And 
after the War was ended, it worked up the wages of inferior 
mass-labour to a grotesque height and at the same 
time imposed the eight-hour day. When the workers came 
home from the War, there arose everywhere in the world,

despite the enormous loss in human lives, the famous house- 
famine, due to the desire of the victorious proletarian to 
live under middle-class conditions — and his achievement 
of it. It was the pathetic symbol of the fall of all the ancient 
powers of class and rank. Seen from this aspect, the universal 
inflation of State finances and economic credits was 
for the first time understood for what it was: one of the 
most effective forms of Bolshevism, by which the ruling 
classes of society might be dispossessed, ruined, proletarianized, 
and as a result excluded from political government. 
Since then the world has been ruled by the low short- 
sighted thought of the vulgar man who has suddenly come 
into power. That was the victory! The destruction is complete, 
the future is almost hopeless, but the spirit of revenge 
upon society is appeased. Meanwhile things now appear 
as they are. The pitiless logic of history takes its revenge 
on the avengers — on the vulgar mentality, on the envious, 
the dreamers, the enthusiasts, who have been blind to the 
great and chilling facts of reality. 

Thirty million white workers are workless today, in 
spite of the great war-losses and leaving out of account 
those other millions who are only partially occupied. This 
is not the result of the War, for half of them live in countries 
which took barely any part, or no part at all, in the 
War; neither is it the result of war debts or misguided currency 
manoeuvres, such as other countries can show. Unemployment 
stands everywhere in exact proportion to the 
height of the political wage-tariffs. It hits the individual 
countries in exact proportion to the respective numbers of

white industrial workers. In the United States it is first the 
Anglo-Americans, whose labour is no longer required, then 
the East and South-East European immigrants, and finally, 
a long way behind them, the Negroes. It is just the same in 
Latin America and South America. In France the number 
is smaller, primarily because her Socialistic deputies know 
the difference between theory and practice and sell themselves 
with all speed to the reigning financiers instead of 
extorting wages for their constituents. But in Russia, Japan, 
China, and India there is no lack of work, because there are 
no luxury wages. Industry has fled to the coloured races, 
and in white countries only the labour-saving inventions 
and methods pay for themselves, because they relieve the 
wage-pressure. For decades now the increase of production 
with the same number of workers by means of technical 
refinements has been the ultimate means of enduring this 
pressure. Now it can no longer be borne, because the markets 
are lacking. Formerly the wages of Birmingham, 
Essen, and Pittsburgh provided the world standard, but 
now this is given by the coloured wage of Java, Rhodesia, 
and Peru. And to that must be added the levelling down of 
the aristocratic society of the white nations with their inherited 
wealth, their gradually acquired taste, their need 
of real luxury, which sets the example to others. The Bolshevism 
of the death duties and supertaxes levied at the 
dictates of envy — in England even before the War^ — 
and the inflations which transformed whole fortunes into 
nothing have done their work thoroughly. But it is this

genuine luxury that had created and maintained quality
work, had allowed entire quality-industries to grow up,
and had kept them alive. It tempted and educated the
middle strata to greater refinement in its own demands.
The greater this luxury, the more flourishing the economic
system. Napoleon of old knew this. He did not concern himself
with economic theories and was the better able to
understand the economic life. It was from his court that the
impulse came to revive the economic system which the
Jacobins had destroyed, for a higher social order was
again being formed — on the English model, it is true,
because the old regime was murdered or ruined, save for
some jejune and impoverished remnants. When the wealth
that has accumulated among the ruling class is annihilated
by the mob, when it becomes an object of suspicion and
scorn, a danger to the owner, then the Nordic will to
acquire property, will-to-power through property, ceases
to create that wealth. Economic — spiritual — ambition
dies out. Competition no longer pays. We sit in corners, go
without things, and save — and this “saving,” which always
means the saving of other people’s work, inevitably
drives every highly developed economy to disaster. All
this works together. Low-grade white labour is worthless,
the labour mass in the Northern coal areas has become
superfluous. It is the first great defeat of the white nations
by the mass of the coloured nations — which embraces
Russians, South Spaniards and South Italians, and the
peoples of Islam just as much as the Negroes of English-speaking
America and the Indians of Latin America. It is

The first menacing sign that white world-supremacy is faced 
with the possibility of an overthrow by the forces of colour, 
as the result of the class war in its rear. 

And no one withal dares to look into the real causes of 
this catastrophe, or down into its abysses. The white world 
is governed primarily by idiots — if it is governed at all, 
which one is entitled to doubt. Around the sick-bed of the 
white economic system stand ridiculous authorities who 
can see no further ahead than next year and from their 
narrow and long obsolete economic “capitalistic,” “Socialistic” 
standpoints discuss minor palliatives. And finally, cowardice 
makes blind. No one speaks of the consequences of this 
century and more of the world revolution which has risen 
from the depths of our great cities and destroyed economic 
life — and not that alone. No one sees it, no one dares to 
see it. 

The “working man” is, now as before, the idol of the 
world, and the “labour leader” is placed above criticism 
in deference to the tendency for which his existence stands. 
For all the loud abuse of Marxism, Marxism itself speaks 
in every word of it. Its most whole-hearted opponents are, 
all unwittingly, obsessed by it. And every one of us is a bit 
of a Socialist or Communist in the bottom of his heart.^ 
Hence the universal unwillingness to admit the fact of 
the prevailing class war and to deduce its consequences. 
Instead of ruthlessly opposing the causes of the catastrophe, 
so far as that is at all possible, we try to suppress the results, 
the symptoms — and not even to suppress them,

THE WHITE WORLD-REVOLUTION

but to whitewash, conceal, and deny them. There is not
the beginning of any reconsideration of the revolutionary
wage-level, but the new revolutionary demand for the
forty-hour week, a further step on the way to Marxism, a
further curtailment of white labour’s output without reduction
of income, a further rise in the cost of white labour,
that is — for it is axiomatic that the political wage must
not fall. No one dares to tell the mass of the workers that
their victory has been their heaviest defeat; that labour
leaders and Labour parties have led them to it for the sake
of appeasing their own hunger for popularity, power, and
well-paid posts; and that these are still far from the idea
of releasing their victims and effacing themselves. But all
the time the coloured races are working long and cheaply
right to the limit of their working-capacity; in Russia under
the knout, but elsewhere with the silent conviction that already
they hold the hated white men, their masters of today
— or of yesterday? — in their power.

Then there is that catchword of “abolishing” unemployment,
“providing” employment — that is to say,
superfluous, useless work, since there is no longer any essential,
profitable, useful work to be had in these conditions
— and no one admits to himself that the cost of this production
without a market, of these faked Potemkin villages
in an economic wilderness, must come in time to be made good
by means of “fiscal Bolshevism” (which includes provision
of fictitious means of payment) from the relics of
the healthy peasant class and urban society. Then, again,
there is dumping, by means of systematic depreciation of

172 ] 

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

the currency—whereby one particular country seeks to 
maintain a market for its products at the expense of others. 
This is at bottom a false and all too easy miscalculation 
of real wages and real costs of production by which the 
buyer is deceived and of which, once more, what is left of 
the property of the rest of the nation has to bear the costs 
in the form of depreciation of values. But the fall of the 
pound, a huge sacrifice for England’s pride, did not diminish 
the number of the unemployed—no, not by one man. 
There is only one form of dumping which has its natural 
roots in economic life and is therefore successful, the form 
of cheaper wages and greater output of labour. This is the 
basic reason for the destructive influence of Russian exports 
and of the factual superiority of “coloured” areas 
of production like Japan, whether they are engaged in 
industry or agriculture and whether they are killing white 
production by their own exports or by exporting themselves 
or by keeping home products so cheap as to exclude 
imports. 

Finally there is the last desperate measure resorted to 
by the mortally stricken economies of nations: autarchy 
—or whatever big word may be chosen to describe this 
attitude of the dying animal. It manifests itself in the reciprocal 
putting down of economic barrages by political 
methods, by hostile tariffs, import prohibitions, boycotts, 
blockage of currency transfers, and everything else that 
has been or will be invented to establish a “state of siege” 
that almost represents actual war conditions and may one 
day put it into the heads of the militarily stronger powers

that such gates may possibly be opened and economic capitulation 
enforced by a timely allusion to tanks and bombing squadrons. 
For, again be it said: the economic system is no self-contained 
kingdom; it is inseparably bound up with world politics; it is 
unthinkable without a strong foreign policy, and therefore, in 
the last resort, it is dependent upon the military strength of 
the country in which it lives or dies.^1 

But what is the sense of defending a fortress if the enemy is 
within it, if treason in the form of class war leaves it doubtful 
whom and what one is really defending? Here lie the real and 
difficult problems of our time. But the raison d’être of grave 
questions is precisely that they should call forth the best efforts 
of the best brains. And when we see how, all the world over, 
they are whittled down, lied down, to the level of small fictitious 
problems, so that small men with small ideas and small expedients 
can make themselves important; when the “guilt” of the economic 
catastrophe is laid upon the War and the war debts, on inflation 
and currency difficulties, and when “returning to prosperity” and 
“ending unemployment” are all that people can find to say, and 
say unblushingly, about the finale of an overwhelming world- 
historical epoch — then may we well despair of the future. We 
live in one of the mightiest ages in all history, and no one sees, 
no one realizes it. We are experiencing a volcanic eruption that 
is without parallel. Night has set in, the earth trembles, and 
streams of lava are rolling down over entire nations — and we

to the handful of the thoroughbreds. It is the great 
individuals who make history, and whatever presents itself 
“en masse” can only be its object.

This world-revolution, however, is not over. It will outlast 
the middle, and possibly the end, of the century. It strides 
on unchecked towards its ultimate decisions with the historical 
ruthlessness of a great destiny which no past Civilization 
has been able to evade and to which all white nations 
of the present must inevitably succumb. Anyone who announces 
its end or believes that he has overcome it is simply 
incapable of understanding it. Its most forceful decades 
are only now setting in on us. Every leading personality in 
the age of the Gracchan Revolution — Scipio as much as 
his opponent Hannibal, Sulla no less than Marius — every 
great event, the fall of Carthage, the Spanish Wars, the 
revolt of the Italian allies, and the slave-revolts from Sicily 
to Asia Minor, are simply forms in which this deep inward 
crisis of society, the organic structure of the Culture-
peoples, moves towards its fulfilment. It was the same in 
the Egypt of the Hyksos period, in the China of the “Contending 
States,” and everywhere else in “contemporary” 
sections of history,^ little as we may know about it. In this 
respect we are all slaves of history’s “will,” the organs of 
an organic happening, working with it and for it; and, as 
Schiller says, he who would set out to manage it prudently

must himself train it towards its non-fulfilment. In this 
tremendous duel between major tendencies, which is being 
fought throughout the white world in wars, revolutions, 
strong personalities that are vessels of high success and 
deep tragedy, powerful but fugitive creations, the offensive 
comes at present from below, from the city masses, and the 
defensive from above is still feeble and lacks the good 
conscience which necessity brings. The end will be in sight 
only when the relation is inverted. And this is near at hand. 

In such times there are, under whatever names, two 
natural parties, two fronts in the class war, two internal 
forces and tendencies, and only two, no matter how many 
party organizations exist or whether such exist at all. There 
is proof of this in the progressive Bolshevization of the 
masses in the United States, in the Russian style that informs 
thoughts, hopes, and wishes. That is a party.^1 So far 
there is no focus of resistance against it in that country, 
which has no yesterday and perhaps no morrow. The brilliant 
episode of the dollar and dollar society, starting from 
the War of Secession in 1865, seems to be approaching its 
end. Will Chicago be the Moscow of the New World? In 
England the Oxford Union, which is the principal students’ 
club of the most aristocratic university in the country, has 
passed by a sweeping majority the resolution: “That this 
House will in no circumstances fight for King and Country.” 
What this signifies is the end of the mentality which 
has up till now reigned among all party-formations. It is 
not impossible that the Anglo-Saxon powers are beginning 

^1 Pages 70 et seq.

THE HOUR OF DECISION 


to fade out. And the West-European Continent? The 
country least troubled with this white Bolshevism is — 
Russia, which has no longer any “party,” but a governing 
“horde” of the old Asiatic type under that name. Neither 
is there any longer faith in a program; there is only the 
fear of death — through being deprived of one’s food 
card or one’s pass, banishment to a labour camp, bullet, 
or rope. 

Vainly, in their cowardice, whole classes of society seek 
a conciliatory middle course between radical tendencies 
of “Right” and “Left.” The age itself is Radical. It will 
have no compromises. There is no doing away with or 
denying the fact of the existing superiority of the Left, or 
the awakening will to a Right movement, which for the 
present has a footing only in close circles, in certain armies, 
and, among other places, in the English House of Lords. 
That is why the English Liberal party has vanished and 
why its heir, the Labour party, will also vanish in its present 
form. That is why the centre parties in Germany vanished 
without resistance. The will to the middle way is the 
senile wish for peace at any price, for a Switzerland of 
nations, for historical abdication, as if thereby the blows 
of history could be avoided. The opposition of graded 
social structure and town masses, of tradition and Bolshevism, 
of the higher existence of the few and the lower of 
mass labour (however labelled), is upon us. There is no 
third alternative. 

But it is just as much an error to believe in the possibility 
of a single party. Parties are Liberal-Democratic forms

THE WHITE WORLD-REVOLUTION 

of Opposition. They presuppose a counter-party. One party 
is as impossible in a State as is one State in a stateless 
world. The political frontier — of country or mentality — 
always separates two powers from each other. It is the 
infantile disease of all revolutions, this belief in a triumphant 
unity when in fact the problem of the age from which 
they themselves spring demands discord. Not in this wise 
are the great problems of history to be solved. They must 
and will mature and so pass on to new problems, new 
battles. The “Total State”—an Italian catchword which has 
an international vogue, was realized by the Jacobins during 
the two years of the Terror. But as soon as they had 
annihilated the fallen powers of the old regime and 
founded the dictatorship, they split up themselves into 
Girondists and Montagnards, and the first-named of these 
occupied the place left vacant. Their leaders fell victims 
to the Left, but their successors in turn treated the Left in 
the same way. Then, with Thermidor, there set in the period 
of waiting for a successful general. It is possible to destroy 
a party in so far as it consists of an organization and a 
bureaucracy of salaried officials, but not one which is a 
movement, a spiritual and intellectual force. The struggle, 
which is a necessity of nature, is merely transferred within 
the surviving party, in which two fronts will be formed to 
carry it on. The fact may be gainsaid or covered up, but it 
is there. 

This is true of Fascism and of every other of the many 
movements after the Fascist model that have arisen or (as, 
say, in America) are arising. Here every individual is

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

confronted with an inevitable choice. It behoves him to 
know definitely where he stands, on the Right or the Left; 
otherwise the course of history, which is stronger than all 
theory and ideological dreaming, will decide for him. 
Conciliation is as impossible today as in the time of the 
Gracchi. 

Western Bolshevism is dead nowhere — except in Russia. 
Its fighting organizations may be destroyed, but it lives 
on in new forms; as Left wing of the party which thinks 
it has conquered it; as a mentality as to the existence of 
which in their own thought individuals and masses alike 
are capable of complete self-deception; ^ and as a movement 
that breaks out suddenly one day in organized forms. 

What do we mean by “Left”? Last century’s catchwords 
such as Socialism, Marxism, Communism, are out 
of date; they no longer mean anything. We use them to 
avoid disclosing where we really stand. But the age demands 
clarity. “Left” is the party which believes in parties, 
for this is a Liberal form of the fight against high society, 
of class war since 1770, of the longing for majorities, for 
“all” to be in the running, for quantity instead of quality, 
for the herd against the master. But the true Caesarism of 
all declining Culture takes its stand upon small, strong 
minorities. “Left” is that which has a program, for a 
program presupposes an intellectual, Rationalistic, and 
Romantic belief in the power to control reality by abstractions. 
“Left” is the noisy agitation at the street corners

and in public meetings, the art of overthrowing city crowds 
by strong words and weak arguments: it was in the time of 
the Gracchi that Latin prose developed into that oratorical 
style which is good for nothing but the hair-splitting rhetoric 
which we find in Cicero. “Left” is the enthusiasm 
for mass in general as a foundation for one’s individual 
power, the will to level everything distinctive, to equate the 
artisan with the people while casting derisive side-glances 
at the peasantry and bourgeoisie. 

A party is not only antiquated as a form; its basis is also 
a mass ideology that is already antiquated, it sees things 
from below, it runs after the thought of the majority. 
“Left” is, finally and above all, lack of respect for property — 
although no race has so strong an instinct of possession 
as the Germanic, and that precisely because it has 
been the strongest-willed of all historical races. Will-to-possession 
is the Nordic meaning of life. It controls and 
shapes our whole history, commencing from the conquering 
expeditions of semi-mythical kings down to the form 
of the family at the present day, which dies when the idea 
of property fades out. Where the instinct for this is lacking, 
“race” is not. 

The great danger for the coming middle of our century 
lies in this, that we are prolonging the life of that which 
we could overthrow. It is a generation of semi-solutions 
and transitions. But as long as this is possible, the Revolution 
is not at an end. The Caesarism of the future will not 
persuade, it will conquer by force of arms. Only when all

This has become self-evident — when we feel majorities
to be a pretext, and despise them; when someone arises
who is able to look down upon the mass, the party in every
sense of the word, and on all programs and ideologies —
only then will the Revolution have been overcome. Even
in Fascism there exists the Gracchan fact of two fronts —
on the left the lower-class town population and on the right
the nation graded up from peasantry to ruling classes —
but the fact is kept under by the Napoleonic vigour of one
individual. This polarity is not, and cannot be, liquidated,”
and it will emerge again, the moment when this iron hand
leaves the helm, in the bitter struggles of his Diadochi. For
Fascism is also a transition. It had its origin in the city
mobs and began as a mass party with noise and disturbance
and mass oratory. Labour-Socialist tendencies are not
unknown to it. But so long as a dictatorship has “social
service” ambitions, asserts that it is there for the “worker's”
sake, courts favour in the streets, and is “popular,”
so long it remains an interim form. The Caesarism of the
future fights solely for power, for empire, and against
every description of party.

Every ideological movement believes in the definitiveness
of its achievements. It repudiates the idea that “after
it” history should go on. It still lacks the Caesarian scepticism
and contempt for humanity, the deep sense of the
fleetingness of all phenomena. Mussolini’s creative idea

Apart from the fact that in a Southern country that has a semi-tropical
mode of life and a “race” to correspond, that is industrially weak and therefore
has an undeveloped proletariat, the Nordic sharpness of opposition does
not exist. In such a country as England, for instance, this kind of Fascism
could neither arise nor maintain itself

THE WHITE WORLD-REVOLUTION 

was grand, and it has had an international effect; it revealed 
a possible form for the combating of Bolshevism. 
But this form arose out of imitating the enemy and is therefore 
full of dangers: revolution from below, organized 
and participated in for the greater part by men from below; 
an armed party-militia, paralleled in Caesar’s Rome 
by the bands of Clodius and Milo; the tendency to subordinate 
intellectual and economic leadership to executive 
working-out because of inability to understand it; to disregard 
other’s property, to confuse the conceptions of nation 
and mass — in a word, the Socialistic ideology of last 
century. 

This all belongs to the past. What anticipates the future 
is not the being of Fascism as a party, but simply and solely 
the figure of its creator. Mussolini is no party leader, although 
he was formerly a labour leader; he is the lord of 
his country. Probably his prototype Lenin would also have 
arrived at that point had he lived longer, for he certainly 
had a cool ruthlessness vis a vis his party and he had also 
the courage to lead the retreat from ideologies of every 
kind. Mussolini is first and foremost a statesman, ice-cold 
and sceptical, realist, diplomat. He does in very truth rule 
alone. He sees everything — and that is the rarest gift in 
an absolute ruler. Even Napoleon was isolated by his entourage. 
The most difficult victories of a ruler, and the 
most essential, are not those won over enemies, but those 
won over his own supporters, the praetorians, the “Ras,” 
as they are called in Italy. That is the best of the born ruler. 
He who does not know this and has neither the power nor

the courage for it swims like a cork on the waves, on the
summit and yet impotent. The perfection of Caesarism is
dictatorship — not the dictatorship of a party, but that of
one man against all parties, and, most of all, above his own.
Every revolutionary movement reaches its victory with a
vanguard of praetorians — who are henceforth of no more
use, but merely dangerous. The real master is known by the
manner in which he dismisses them, ruthlessly and without
thanks, intent only on his goal, to reach which he must first
pick his men — and this he knows how to do. The French
Revolution ran contrary to this in the beginning: no one
had the power, everyone wanted it; everyone commanded,
no one obeyed.

Mussolini is a master-man with the Southern cunning of
the race in him, like the condottieri of the Renaissance, and
is therefore able to stage his movement in entire consonance
with the character of Italy — home of opera — without
ever being intoxicated by it himself, though even Napoleon
was not quite free from this weakness, and in the case of
Rienzi, for instance, it was fatal. When Mussolini appeals
to the Prussian archetype, he is right: he is far less closely
related to Napoleon than to Frederick the Great, and even
to Frederick’s father.

I have now reached the point when the definitive word
must be said about “Prussianism” and “Socialism.” In

1919 I compared the two, the one a living idea and the
other the catchword of a whole century,¹ and was — I am
tempted to add: “of course”— not understood. People

no longer know how to read — this great art, still known
in the age of Goethe, has died out. They skim printed pages
“mass-wise,” and, as a rule, the reader demoralizes the
book. I showed that in the working class, as Bebel welded
it into a powerful army, in its discipline and loyal subordination,
its good comradeship, its readiness for the ultimate
sacrifice, there still lived that Old-Prussian “style”
which first proved itself in the battles of the Seven Years’
War. What mattered then was the individual Socialist as a
character, his “moral imperative,” not the Socialism hammered
into his head, which was a wholly un-Prussian mixture
of foolish ideology and vulgar greed. I pointed out
also that this type of being “in form” for a task was a
tradition going back to the Teutonic Order, by which in the
Gothic centuries — as again today — the frontier guard of
the Faustian Culture was kept up against Asia. This ethical
attitude, unconscious as is every genuine life-style, and
therefore to be awakened and trained only by living example
and not by talk and writing, stood forth in its splendour
in August 1914 — the army had trained Germany —
and was betrayed by the parties in 1918 when the State
went under. Since then this disciplined will has again raised
its head in the National movement; not in its programs
and parties, but in the ethical attitude of an elite, as individuals;¹
and it is possible that, starting from this foundation,
the German people may by perseverance be slowly
trained for its difficult future. This is essential if we are not
to succumb in the battles that lie ahead.

But the shallow-minded cannot get away from the
Marxian thought of last century. Throughout the world
they think of Socialism not as a moral attitude of life but
as economic Socialism, Labour Socialism, as a mass ideology
with material aims. Program Socialism of every sort is
thinking from below, building on base instincts, canonizing
the herd-feeling which everywhere today lurks behind
the slogan of “overcoming individualism.” It is the contrary
of Prussian feeling, which has livingly experienced
through exemplary leaders the necessity of disciplined devotion
and possesses accordingly the inward freedom that
comes with the fulfilment of duty, the ordering of oneself,
command of oneself, for the sake of a great aim.

Labour-Socialism in every form, on the other hand, is, as
I have already shown,¹ definitely English in origin. It arose,
about 1840, simultaneously with the victory of the joint-stock
company and the rootless “financial” form of capital.² Both were the expression of Free Trade Manchesterism:
this “white” Bolshevism is capitalism from below,
wage-capitalism, just as speculative finance-capital in respect
of its methods is Socialism from above, from the
stock exchange. Both grew out of the same intellectual root;
thinking in money,³ trading in money on the pavements of
the world’s capitals, whether as wage-levels or profits on
exchange rates makes no odds. There is no contradiction
between economic Liberalism and Socialism. The Labour
market is the stock exchange of the organized proletariat.

The trade unions are trusts for forcing up wages on the 
mines followed by oil, steel, and bank trusts of the Anglo-American 
type, whose finance-Socialism penetrates, dominates, 
sucks, and controls them to the point of systematic 
economic expropriation. The devastating, dispossessing 
effect of bundles of shares and bonds, the separation of 
mere “ credit ” from the responsible directive work of the 
entrepreneur, who no longer knows to whom his work actually 
belongs, has not received anything like adequate 
consideration. Productive economy is in the last resort 
nothing but the will-less object of stock-exchange manoeuvres. 
It was only the rise of the share system to domination 
that enabled the stock exchange (formerly a mere aid to 
economy) to assume the decisive control of economic life. 
Finance-Socialists and trust magnates like Morgan and 
Kreuger correspond absolutely to the mass-leaders of Labour 
parties and the Russian economic commissars; dealer-natures 
with the same parvenu tastes. From both sides, 
today as in the days of the Gracchi, the conservative forces 
of the State — army, property, peasant, and manager — 
are being attacked. 

But the Prussian style demands not only a mere precedence 
of higher policy over economics; it demands that 
the economic life should be disciplined by a powerful 
State, which is the precondition of free initiative in private 
enterprise — for, whatever else it may be, it is not a mere 
super-party, complete with program and ready to press 
organization to the point of abolishing the idea of property 
(Eigentum); which, precisely among Germanic peoples,

denotes freedom of the economic will, and lordship over
that which is one’s own.* “Disciplining” is the training of
a racehorse by an experienced rider and not the forcing of
the living economic body into the strait-jacket of an economic
plan or its transformation into a press-the-button
machine. “Prussian” is also the aristocratic ordering of
life according to the grade of achievement. Prussian is,
above all, the undisputed precedence of foreign policy, the
successful steering of the State in a world of states, over
internal policy, which exists solely to keep the nation in
form for this task and becomes mischievous and criminal
as soon as it begins to follow independently its own ideological
aims. Herein lies the weakness of most revolutions,
whose leaders, having risen through demagogy and learnt
nothing else, are unable to find their way from thinking
on party lines to thinking in terms of statesmanship. This
was the case with Danton and Robespierre. Mirabeau and
Lenin died too soon, Mussolini was successful. But the
future belongs to the great fact-men, now that the world-
improvers, who have preened themselves on the stage of
world history since Rousseau, have vanished and left no
trace.

Prussian is, lastly, a character which disciplines itself,
such as that of Frederick the Great, which he himself paraphrased
as consisting in being the First Servant of the State.
Such a servant is no lackey, but when Bebel opined that
the German people had the soul of a lackey, he was right as

The Old Germanic word eigan means to rule; not only to have something,
but to be in absolute control of it.

So far as the majority were concerned. His own party proved 
it in 1918. The lackeys of success are more numerous with 
us than elsewhere, although they have in all ages and all 
nations crowded the herd of humanity. It is a matter of 
indifference whether Byzantinism performs its orgies before 
money-bags, political success, a title, or merely Gessler’s 
hat. When Charles II landed in England, there were 
suddenly no Republicans left. To be a servant of the State 
is an aristocratic virtue, of which few are possessed. If 
this is “Socialistic,” it is a proud and exclusive Socialism 
for men of race, for the elect of life. Prussianism is a very 
superior thing which sets itself against every sort of majority 
and mob-rule; above all, against the dominance 
of the mass character. Moltke, the great educator of the 
German officer, the finest example of true Prussianism in 
the nineteenth century, was thus constituted. Count Schlieffen 
summed up his personality in the motto; “Talk little, 
do much, be, rather than seem.” 

This idea of a “Prussian” existence will be the starting- 
point for the ultimate overcoming of the World Revolution. 
There is no other possibility. I said, as far back as 1919: 
Not everyone is a Prussian who is born in Prussia; the type 
is possible anywhere in the white world and actually occurs, 
though rarely. It lies at the root of the provisional form 
of national movements everywhere — there is nothing 
definitive about them — and the question is to what extent 
it can be liberated from the quickly ageing, popular, party- 
democratic elements of Liberal and Socialist Nationalism 
that control it, for the time being. The silent national feel-

Rising of the English about 1900, which today has begun to
waver, the boastful, shallow chauvinism of the French, so
noisily in evidence in the Dreyfus Affair, were both of this
order and found support, the one in the cult of the navy,
the other in the army. America possesses nothing of this
kind — “hundred-per-cent American” is a phrase — but
she needs it if she is to endure as a nation at all after the
approaching clash between crouching Communism and the
high finance which is already undermined. The Prussian
idea is opposed to finance-Liberalism as well as to Labour-
Socialism. Every description of mass and majority, everything
that is “Left,” it regards as suspect. Above all, it is
opposed to any weakening of the State and to the desecrating
misuse of it for economic interests. It is conservative
and “Right,” and it grows out of whatever fundamental
life-forces still exist in Nordic peoples: instinct for power
and possessions; for possessions as power; for inheritance,^
fecundity, and family, which three belong together; for
distinctions of rank and social gradation, whose mortal
enemy was (or is) Rationalism from 1750 to 1950. Present-
day Nationalism is, together with the monarchical idea
latent in it, a transition. It is a preliminary step towards
Caesarism, no matter how far away that may seem. It is
there that we find abhorrence of all Liberal and Socialist
party systems, of every kind of popularity (which invariably
compromises the object of it), of everything which
rises up in masses and will have its say. This trait, though

it may be buried deep under tendencies more in keeping
with the age, has the future on its side — and the future’s
leaders. All really great leaders in history go “Right,”
however low the depths from which they have climbed. It
is the mark of the born master and ruler. This applies to
Cromwell and Mirabeau as much as to Napoleon. The riper
the age, the more prospects does this road open up. The
elder Scipio went under in the conflict between the traditions
of his origins, which forbade an illegal dictatorship,
and the historical position which he had obtained (without
desiring it) through saving Rome from the Carthaginian
danger. He died in a distant land. At that time the revolutionary
movement was only just beginning to undermine the
tradition-bound forms, so that the younger Scipio had still
a very weak position against the Gracchi, but Sulla’s was
already a very strong one against Marius, and finally
Caesar, who had begun as a Catilinarian, met with no more
party opposition at all, for the Pompeians were not a
party, but supporters of an individual. The World Revolution,
strong as it may be at the beginning, ends, not in
victory or defeat, but in resignation on the part of the
forward-driven masses. Their ideals are not refuted, but
merely become boring, and eventually no one can be
brought to get excited about them. Anyone who talks about
the end of the “bourgeoisie” writes himself down as still
a proletarian, and the future is not for him. A “non-
bourgeois” society can be maintained only by a Terror,
and only for a few years at that, for presently people are
sick of it — and incidentally the labour leaders will mean

who have become new bourgeois. This is not a process that
appeals to the taste of true leader-natures.

Socialism of every kind is today as antiquated as its first
Liberal form and as everything else that is connected with
party and program. The century of the worker cult, 1840
to 1940, is irrevocably ending, and those who acclaim “the
worker” at this stage have* no understanding of the time.
This worker is stepping back into the whole of the nation,
no longer as its spoilt nurseling, but as the lowest grade in
an urban society. The contrasts worked up in the class war
will again become the permanent differences^ of high and
low, and will be accepted as such. It is the resignation of
the Imperial period in Rome, the period in which there were
no economic problems of this nature left. But how much
can be destroyed and levelled down in the final stages of
world anarchy! So much, indeed, that in certain white
nations there will be no material left from which a Caesar
could create his structure, his army — for armies will in
future take the place of parties — and his State.

Is there, in that which in all white countries that took
part in the War calls itself (vaguely enough) “Youth”
and the “front-generation,”^ anything like a weight-carrying
foundation for such men and for the tasks of the
future?

The profound shock of the Great War, which swept away
everyone’s lazy illusions of security and of progress being
the meaning of history, is nowhere more evident than in the

spiritual chaos left in its wake. The fact that we are not
in the least aware of this and believe that we carry within
us a new order is the best possible proof of its existence.
To those who were born about 1890 the sight of a really
commanding figure has been denied. The figures of Bismarck
and Moltke, not to speak of those of other countries,
had already vanished in the mists of a historical literature.
They might have formed a standard for real greatness, but
not without a living present; and the War produced not one
important monarch, prominent statesman, or victorious
battle-thinker at the decisive point. All the statues and
street-names in the world will not change the fact. The
result was a complete lack of the sense of authority among
the millions who returned home on both sides. It was seen
in youth’s unrestrained criticism of everything that came
to hand, of men and of things, while never a trace of self-
criticism was seen. It laughed at yesterday without suspect-
ing that its power persisted. Most of all, the chaos mani-
fested itself in the way in which everyone screamed for a
dictatorship on his own lines without knowing of any dic-
tator or being able to recognize one, in the way in which a
leader was chosen and worshipped one day and rejected
the next — Primo de Rivera, d’Annunzio, Ludendorff —
and the way in which leadership was a problem to be dis-
cussed, not a fact to be waited for and accepted from the
moment it was there. Political dilettantism talked large.
Everyone wrote to tell his future dictator what he ought to
do. Everyone demanded discipline from other people, be-
cause he was incapable of disciplining himself. Because
[197]

they had forgotten what a State’s governor is, men became
hysterical over programs and ideals and plunged in speech
and writing into wild dreams of this and that imperative
transformation — assuming quite as a matter of course
that such were possible. The lack of respect for history has
at no time been greater than in these years. That history
had its own logic, on which all programs are shipwrecked,
no one knew or would admit. But Bismarck attained his
end because he had comprehended the course of history in
his century and adapted himself to it. That was high policy,
the art of the possible.

From the “youth” of Germany, England, Spain, all
the white countries, who in their incomprehension hoped to
“end” a two centuries’ process of world change from below
— and in the form of Bolshevism, of which they had such
store in themselves — came the typical revolutionary out-
cry against “individualism.” But they are all small indi-
viduals — very small — without talent or depth, but for
that very reason obsessed by the convulsive need to be ad-
mittedly right. They therefore hated the superiority of
people greater than themselves, men who could regard
themselves with at least a tinge of scepticism. All revolu-
tionaries are humourless — and this causes their fall. Petty
obstinacy and lack of humour: that is the definition of
fanaticism. They were quite unaware that leadership, au-
thority, and respect on the one hand, and “Socialism” on
the other, are irreconcilable. This anti-individualism is the
theoretical fashion of the moment among the intellectuals-
in-spite-of-themselves of all white countries. Yesterday it

was individualism that was the mode, and as a matter of
fact there is not so much difference between the two. Feeble
as is this type of Geist, it is the only one they possess. It is
the megalopolitan “literariness,” nothing more, and anything
but novel; for the Jacobins had already talked themselves
hoarse over it. Lack of intelligence is not quite a
good enough weapon wherewith to defeat Rationalism.

And in what does it consist, the “Socialism” of these
heroes who take the field against the freedom of personality?
It is the impersonal Asiatic collectivism of the East,
the spirit of the great plains’ in association with the Western
levee en masse of 1792. And what in fact is it that is
“in revolt”? The insignificant, with number as their sole
power. There is a great deal of underground Slav in them;
remnants of prehistoric races and their primitive reasoning;
envy, too, of Russianness, whose undeveloped will exempts
it from the torment which possesses inferior minds when
they want something but do not know what, are obliged to
want it and do not dare. He who has not the courage to be
the hammer must be content to play the part of the anvil.
The part is not without its consolations. The urge to be released
from one’s own will, to be submerged in the lazy
majority, to know the happiness of a lackey’s soul, to be
spared the master’s anxieties—all this is here disguised
under big words. The Romanticism of the insignificant! The
apotheosis of the herd-feeling! The last final way to idealize
one’s own dread of responsibility! This kind of hatred of
individualism, arising out of cowardice and shame, is a

mere caricature of that of the great fourteenth- and fifteenth- 
century mystics, with their anti-egoism, the “Lassen der 
Ichheit” of the “Theologie deutsch.” ^ They were strong 
souls who livingly experienced the tremendous, truly Germanic 
solitude of the “I” in the world, and out of their 
torment conceived the burning desire to go up in God or 
the All or whatever they might call it, and which turned out 
in fact to be themselves. The strong, unbending “I” was 
their destiny. Every attempt to overstep its boundary merely 
showed that it had none. Today there is a simpler method: 
one turns “Socialist” and runs down the “I” of other 
people. 

One’s own “I” gives no more trouble. The levelling out 
of brains is complete; one meets “in the mass,” wills “in 
the mass,” thinks “in the mass.” Those who do not think 
with it, who think for themselves, are felt to be enemies. 
It is now the mass, and not the godhead, in which the lazy, 
stupid “I,” suffering from all manner of inhibitions, “submerges” 
itself; and that, too, is “release.” It is almost 
mystical. They knew that in 1792. It is the craving of the 
mob to run and to act with the rest. But the Prussian “style” 
is renunciation by one’s own free will, the strong “I” 
bowing before a great duty and task, an act of self-government, 
and, as such, the height in individualism that is possible 
in the present. 

The Celtic-Germanic “race” is the strongest-willed that 
the world has ever seen. But this “I will — I will!” which 
fills the Faustian soul to the brim, which is the ultimate

meaning of its being, and controls every expression of its 
Culture in thought, deed, and standards, awakened also 
the consciousness of the “I’s” complete loneliness in endless 
space. Will and loneliness are in the last resort the 
same thing. Hence Moltke’s taciturnity and, from another 
aspect, the need in Goethe’s softer and more feminine 
nature for perpetual confessions before a self-chosen environment 
which pervades all his works. It was the yearning 
for an echo out of space, the suffering of a tender soul 
from the monologue of its existence. One may pride oneself 
on this loneliness or suffer from it; escape it one cannot. 
The religious man of “eternal truths,” such as Luther, 
sighs for grace and salvation from this fate, fights it, even 
defies it. But the political man of the North develops out of 
it a gigantic defiance of reality: “Thy trust is in thy sword 
more than in Thor,” says an Icelandic saga. If there is such 
a thing as individualism in the world, it is this of an individual 
defying the whole universe, his knowledge of his 
own unbending will, his delight in ultimate decisions and 
love of destiny itself even at the moment when it is breaking 
him. And being “Prussian” consists in bending of one’s 
own free will. The worth of the sacrifice lies in the fact that 
it is hard. If a man has no “I” to offer up, he should not 
talk of loyalty. He merely runs along behind someone onto 
whom he has shifted the responsibility. If there is anything 
that should amaze us today, it is the poverty of the Socialist 
ideal by which it is hoped to save the world. This is no release 
from the forces of the past; it is the continuation of 
their worst tendencies. It is cowardice in the face of life,

THE HOUR OF DECISION

True — truly Prussian — loyalty is what the world
most needs in this age of great catastrophes. We can only
lean on what offers resistance. It is on the realization of this
that the true leader takes his stand. A leader who has risen
from the masses must know, better than most, that masses,
majorities, parties, are no genuine liegemen. They merely
want advantages. They leave their leader in the lurch as
soon as he demands sacrifices. If he thinks and feels as a
product of the mass, history will treat him as a mere demagogue.
It is the parting of the ways to Left and Right: the
demagogue lives with the masses always as one of themselves;
the born ruler can use them, but he despises them.
He fights his most difficult battles, not against the enemy,
but against the swarm of his all-too-devoted friends.

This is why armies, and not parties, are the future form
of power; unselfish, devoted armies, such as Napoleon
never possessed after Wagram. His old soldiers were reliable;
not so his senior officers — and the value of any army
depends in the first place on these. They came to regard
him not as the commander but as the perpetual giver. Once
the required sacrifices outweighed the advantages, it was
all up with the Grand Army.

It is high time that the “white” world, and Germany in
the first place, should consider these facts. For behind the
world wars and the still unfinished proletarian world-revolution
there looms the greatest of all dangers, the coloured
menace, and it will require every bit of “race” that is still
available among white nations to deal with it. Germany, of

The Western Civilization of this century is threatened, not 
by one, but by two world revolutions of major dimensions. 
In both their real compass, their profundity, and their workings 
have so far escaped recognition. The one comes from 
below, the other from without: class war and race war. 
The one now lies to a large extent behind us, although its 
decisive blows — in the Anglo-American zone, for instance 
— are probably still to come. The other first became definite 
in the World War, and it is rapidly acquiring direction 
and form. In the next few centuries both will fight side by 
side, possibly as allies: it will be the severest crisis through 
which the white peoples will have to pass in common — 
whether united or not — if they intend to have any future. 

Such a “ revolution from without ” has set itself up 
against each of the past Cultures also. It has arisen invariably 
among the hopeless downtrodden races of the outer 
ring — “ savages ” or “ barbarians ” — who were exploited 
without means of redress by the unassailable superiority 
of a group of Culture-nations which had reached 
high maturity in their political, military, economic, and 
intellectual forms and methods. This “ colonial style ” is

present in every High Culture. But such hatred did not 
exclude a secret contempt for the alien life-form, which, as 
it gradually became familiar, was scoffingly analysed and 
in the end boldly evaluated according to the limits of its 
efficacy and no more. They, the outsiders, saw that many 
things could be imitated, and that others either could be 
rendered innocuous or were not so potent as had been sup-
posed in the first panic.^ They looked on at the wars and 
revolutions occurring within this world of ruling nations 
and were perforce initiated into the mysteries of arma-
ments, economics, and diplomacy, and thus came at last 
to question the reality of the foreigners’ superiority. And 
once they detected a weakening in those foreigners’ resolu-
tion to command, they began to reflect on the possibilities 
of attack and victory for themselves. Thus it was in China 
in the third century b.c., when the barbarous peoples north 
and west of the Hwang Ho and south of the Yangtze-kiang 
were drawn into the decisive battles of the great powers, 
and in the Arabian world of the time of the Abbassids, 
where Turkish-Mongolian races appeared first as merce-
naries and then as masters. And thus it was in the Classical 
Age above all, where we have an exact picture of events, 
which resemble at every point those towards which we are 
irrevocably moving. 

The Barbarian attacks on the Classical world begin with 
the Celtic movements after 300 b.c., which invariably had

Italy as their objective. In the decisive battle of Sentinum 
(295), Gallic races supported the Etruscans and Samnites 
against Rome, and they were also employed with success 
by Hannibal. About 280, other Celts conquered Macedonia 
and northern Greece, where, in consequence of internal 
political struggles, all State power had ceased to exist, and 
they were checked only at Delphi. In Thrace and Asia 
Minor they founded Barbarian empires over a Hellenized 
and partially Hellenic population. Somewhat later in the 
East of Alexander the Great’s decayed empire, the Bar-
barian reaction against the Hellenic Culture set in, forcing 
it by innumerable insurrections to give ground step by 
step. Thus, from about 100 B.C. a Mithridates, in alliance 
with South Russian “savages” (Scythians and Bastarnae) 
and counting upon the ever-increasing determination of the 
Parthians to push from Eastern Iran towards Syria, had 
reasonable expectations of destroying the Roman State, in 
the chaotic condition to which class wars had reduced it. Not 
until it reached Greece was his advance stopped. Athens and 
other cities had joined him, as well as certain Celtic races 
which were still established in Macedonia. In the Roman 
armies there was open revolution. Individual sections fought 
against each other, and the commanders killed each other 
in the very presence of the enemy (Fimbria). It was then 
that the Roman army ceased to be a national body and 
transformed itself into a personal retinue of individuals.

were not really Carthaginians, but drawn in the main from
the wild races of the Atlas mountains and southern Spain.
And with those Rome had later, from 146 onward, to wage
a terrible and never-ending struggle. (It was the losses of
these wars that brought the Roman peasantry to revolt in
the Gracchan disturbances.) With these same peoples, later
still, the Roman Sertorius attempted to found a State in
opposition to Rome. After 113 B.C. there came the Celtic-
Germanic onset of the Cimbri and Teutones, which was
only repulsed after whole Roman armies had been wiped
out by the revolutionary leader, Marius, and he again had
just returned from his victory over Jugurtha, who had
armed Northern Africa against Rome and by bribing the
Roman politicians had for years prevented any counter-
action. About 60 B.C. there came a second Celtic-Germanic
movement (Suevi, Helvetii), to forestall which Caesar con-
quered Gaul, and at the same time Crassus was defeated
and killed by the Parthians. But that was the end of reaction
by expansion. Caesar’s plan for reconquering the Alexan-
drian Empire and thereby removing the Parthian menace
was never carried out. Tiberius had to set back the frontier
in Germany after it had proved impossible to replace the
troops annihilated in Varus’s defeat and the first great in-
surrection of the frontier legions had taken place on the
death of Augustus. Thenceforward the policy was that of
systematic defence. But the army was taking in more and
more Barbarians. It became an independent power. Ger-
mans, Illyrians, Africans, Arabs, sprang up as leaders,

Yet for whole centuries it was possible to make a systematic 
defence against these conditions, because the orbis 
terrarum of the Roman Empire was an enclosed area with 
frontiers that could be guarded. The position of the present 
Imperium of the white nations, which embraces the whole 
globe and includes the coloured races, is far more difficult. 
White humanity has scattered itself to all quarters in its 
ungovernable urge to infinite distance: over both Americas, 
South Africa, Australia, and innumerable strategic points 
between. The Yellow-Brown-Black-Red menace lurks 
within the field of the white power. It penetrates into and 
participates in the military and revolutionary agreements 
and disagreements of the white powers and threatens one 
day to take matters into its own hands. 

What, then, does the “coloured” world include? Not 
only Africa, the Indians — as well as the Negroes and half- 
breeds — of the whole of America, the Islamic nations, 
China, and India extending to Java, but, above all, Japan 
and Russia, which has again become an Asiatic, “Mongolian” 
State. When the Japanese beat Russia, a ray of hope 
shot up all over Asia: a young Asiatic State had, by Western 
methods, forced the greatest power of the West to its 
knees and thereby destroyed the aureole of invincibility 
which surrounded Europe. It was as a beacon, in India, in

Turkey, even in Cape Colony and the Sahara. So it was 
possible to pay back the white peoples for all the pains and 
humiliations of a century! Since then the profound cunning 
of the Asiatics has been thinking out methods inaccessible 
to European thought and superior to it. And now Russia, 
after suffering in 1916 its second great defeat, from the 
West, has removed its “white mask,” to the mocking satis- 
faction of its ally England, has again become Asiatic with 
all its soul, and is filled with a burning hatred of Europe. 
It took with it the experiences of Europe’s internal weak- 
ness and used its knowledge to invent new and crafty meth- 
ods of fighting, which it has instilled into the whole of the 
earth’s coloured population, with the idea of a common 
resistance. This, side by side with the triumph of Labour- 
Socialism over Society among the white nations, is the 
second real consequence of that World War which brought 
us no nearer to understanding any one of the actual prob- 
lems of world policy and has settled none. This war was 
a defeat of the white races, and the Peace of 1918 was the 
first great triumph of the coloured world: symbolized by 
the fact that today it is allowed to have a say in the disputes 
of the white states among themselves in the Geneva League 
of Nations — which is nothing but a miserable symbol of 
shameful things. 

That Germans abroad should be ill-treated by coloured 
people at the orders of English and French was not a sur- 
prisingly novel procedure. This method began in the Lib- 
eral Revolution of the eighteenth century: in 1775 the 
English enrolled men of Indian race to attack, burn, and

scalped the American republicans, and it should not be for-
gotten how the Jacobins mobilized the Negroes of Haiti for 
the “Rights of Man.” But that coloured men from all over 
the world should be massed on European soil to fight for 
whites against whites, that they came to know the secrets 
of the most modern war-methods and the limits of their 
efficacy, and were sent home with the conviction of having 
beaten white powers, all this fundamentally altered their 
view of the world’s power-distribution. They came to feel 
their own common strength and the weakness of the others; 
they began to despise the whites as erstwhile Jugurtha de-
spised mighty Rome. It was not Germany that lost the 
World War; the West lost it when it lost the respect of the 
coloured races. 

The importance of this shift of the political centre of 
gravity was first realized in Moscow. In Western Europe it 
is still not realized. The white ruling nations have abdicated 
from their former rank. They negotiate today where yes-
terday they would have commanded, and tomorrow they 
will have to flatter if they are even to negotiate. They have 
lost the feeling of the self-evidence of their power and are 
not even aware that they have lost it. In the “revolution 
from without” they have ceded the choice of the hour, to 
America and, above all, to Asia, whose frontier now lies 
along the Vistula and the Carpathians. For the first time 
since the siege of Vienna by the Turks they have again 
been put on the defensive, and they will have to commit 
great forces, both spiritual and military, into the hands of

very great men if they intend to weather the first mighty 
storm, which will not be long in coming. 

In Russia in 1917 both Revolutions, the White and the 
Coloured, broke out together. The one, the shallow, urban 
Revolution of Labour-Socialism, rhetorical and literary 
through and through, with its Western faith in party and 
program, its litterateurs, academic proletarians, and Ni-
hilistic agitators of the Bakunin type, and its alliance with 
the dregs of the great cities, killed off Petrine society, which 
was predominantly Western in origin, and staged a noisy 
cult of the “working man.” The technics of the machine, 
so alien to and hated by the Russian soul, became all at once 
a god and the meaning of life. But below all this the other 
Revolution of the muzhik, the village, the true Asiatic form 
of Bolshevism, was doggedly, silently rising, big with 
promise. The peasant’s eternal hunger for the land, which 
drove all the soldiers back from the front to take part in 
the great land-distribution, was the first expression of it. 
Labour-Socialism soon discovered the danger. After an 
initial alliance it used the hatred nursed by all urban 
parties, whether Liberal or Socialist, for the peasantry to 
wage war against this conservative element, which, in his-
tory, has invariably outlasted all the political, social, and 
economic formations of the city. It dispossessed the peas-
ants, reintroduced in fact the serfdom and compulsory 
labour which Alexander II had abolished in 1862, and by 
its hostile and bureaucratic administration of agriculture 
— every Socialism, when it passes from theory to practice,

soon becomes choked in bureaucracy — carried matters so
far that today the fields are allowed to run wild, the abun-
dant live-stock of the past has shrunk to a fraction, and
starvation of the Asiatic order has become a permanent
condition that only a weak-willed race, born to an existence
of slavery, could endure.

But here “white” Bolshevism is rapidly on the wane.
The Marxian face is only worn for the benefit of the out-
side world, for Southern Asia, Africa, America, where it is
desired to let loose and direct rebellion against the white
powers. A new Asiatic stratum of rulers has taken over
from the Semi-Westerns. It again lives in the villas and
palaces around Moscow, keeps its staff of servants, and
already permits itself to indulge in a barbaric luxury
worthy of predatory Mongolian khans of the fourteenth
century. Here is “wealth,” in a new form that can be
paraphrased in proletarian circumlocutions.

There will also be a return to peasant property, to pri-
vate property in general. The fact of serfdom does not
preclude this, and it can be done; for the army, and no
longer the civilian “party,” has the power. The soldier is
the one creature who does not go hungry in Russia, and he
knows why this is so and for how long. This power is un-
assailable from abroad on account of the geographical
extent of its empire, but it attacks itself. It has mercenaries
and allies all over the world, disguised like itself. Its
strongest weapon is the new revolutionary, truly Asiatic
diplomacy which acts instead of negotiating, from be-
low and from behind, by means of propaganda, murder,

and insane action, and this gives it a vast advantage 
over that of the white countries; for these, in spite of their 
politically-minded advocates and journalists, have not 
yet quite lost the old aristocratic style that derives 
from the Escorial and counts Bismarck as its last great 
master. 

Russia is the lord of Asia, Russia is Asia. Japan belongs 
to Asia only geographically. From the ethnographical point 
of view it undoubtedly stands closer to the eastern Malayan- 
ans, the Polynesians, and certain Indian peoples on the 
west side of America. But on the sea it is what Russia is 
on land; lord of a wide domain in which Western powers 
no longer count. England is not even remotely master of 
“her” Empire to the same extent, even in the coloured 
“Crown”-colonies. Japan extends her influence over a 
wide radius. It is felt in Peru and on the Panama Canal. The 
alleged blood-relationship between Japanese and Mexicans 
has on occasion been emphasized and toasted on both sides.^ 
In Mexico, in the beginning of 1914, leading Indian circles 
plotted the “Plan of San Diego,” having for its object the 
invasion of Texas and Arizona by an army of Indians, 
Negroes, and Japanese. The white population was to be 
massacred, the Negro states were to become independent, 
and a greater Mexico was to arise as a State for the pure 
Indian race.® Had this plan been carried into execution, the 
World War would have started with a completely different 
distribution of the powers and been based on other prob-

problems. The Monroe Doctrine, in the form of dollar-imperialism, 
pointed towards Latin America, would have been 
wiped out by it. Russia and Japan are today the only active 
forces in the world. Through them Asia has become the 
decisive element in world happenings. The white powers 
are actuated by its pressure in their dealings and do not 
even know it. 

This pressure consists in the activity of the Coloured, 
racial Revolution, which is already using the White Revolution 
of the class war as its tool. We have already referred 
to the backgrounds of the economic catastrophe. After 
the revolution from below in the form of Labour-Socialism 
had with its weapon, the political wage, made the breach, 
coloured economy, headed by Russia and Japan, pressed 
in with the lower wage, and it is now proceeding to complete 
the destruction.^ To this must be added political-social 
propaganda in enormous quantities, the true Asiatic 
diplomacy of our day. It pervades all India and Japan. 
It has led in Java and Sumatra to the erection of a race 
front against the Dutch and the disintegration of army and 
navy. It pays court, all the way from Eastern Asia, to the 
highly gifted Indian race living from Mexico to Chili, and 
it inculcates for the first time in the Negroes a community- 

1 When we hear that in Java Japan sells bicycles for less than $3 and 
electric light bulbs for less than two cents, while white countries have to ask 
four times as much even to cover the cost to themselves; when the little 
Javanese peasant with his wife and family offer the self-harvested sack of 
rice at half the cost which the modern planter with his white officials is 
obliged to demand, then indeed we get a glimpse into the abysses of this 
struggle. Since Western technique is no longer secret and can be copied to 
perfection, the contrast is no longer in the method of construction, but only 
in the cost of that production.

feeling that is being directed against the white ruling 
nations. 

Here, too, the White Revolution has since 1770 been 
preparing the soil for the Coloured one. The literature of 
English Liberals like Mill and Spencer, whose trains of 
thought reach back into the eighteenth century, supplied 
the “world outlook” to the higher schools in India. And 
thence the way to Marx was easy for the young reformers 
themselves to find. Sun-Yat-Sen, the leader of the Chinese 
Revolution, found it in America. And out of it all there 
arose a revolutionary literature of which the Radicalism 
puts that of Marx and Borodin far into the shade. 

Like the North American revolt against England, the 
independence movement in Spanish America, dating from 
Bolivar (1811), is unthinkable without the Anglo-French 
revolutionary literature of 1770 — plus the example of 
Napoleon. At first it was exclusively a struggle between 
whites, between the landowning Creole aristocracy, which 
had lived in the country for generations, and the Spanish 
bureaucracy, which kept up the lordly principle of colonial 
subordination. Bolivar, a pure-blooded white like Miranda 
and San Martin, conceived the plan of erecting a monarchy 
that would be supported by a purely white oligarchy. The 
Argentinian dictator, Rosas, a powerful figure in the 
“Prussian” style, also stood for this aristocracy against 
the Jacobinism which soon spread from Mexico to the 
extreme South, finding support in the anti-clerical Masonic 
lodges and demanding universal equality, even of race. 
With this began the movement of Indians, pure and half-

breeds, not only against Spain, but against white blood 
generally. It has gone on without intermission, and today 
it is nearing its goal. Humboldt, even so far back, remarked 
the pride in Iberian descent exhibited there, and the tradition 
of a Visigothic and Basque ancestry is still found in 
Chile’s aristocratic families.’ But the greater part of this 
aristocracy died out or found its way back to Europe during 
the reign of anarchy which began in the middle of the 
nineteenth century, and now policy is dictated by the “caudillos,” 
warlike demagogues from the coloured population. 
Among them are pure-bred Indians of great talent 
like Juarez and Porfirio Diaz. Apart from Argentina, the 
proportion of the upper classes which is white, or calls 
itself so, is from a quarter to one tenth of the population. 
In certain states the doctors, advocates, teachers, even 
officers, are exclusively Indians, who feel themselves akin 
to the half-breed proletariat of the towns (the “mechopelo”) 
in the hatred with which white property inspires 
them, whether it is in the hands of Creoles, Englishmen, 
or North Americans. In Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, 
Aymara is the second official and educational language. 
There is open practice of a cult based on the alleged Communism 
of the Incas, which receives encouragement from 
Moscow. The race ideal of a pure Indian rule is perhaps 
on the verge of realization.^

doctrine that all men are equal before God and that wealth
is sinful, ploughs the soil on which the Bolshevist envoy
sows and reaps. And from the North and the East the missionary
of Islam follows up his tracks with great success,
penetrating in these days as far as the Zambesi in Nyassaland.
Where a Christian school stood yesterday, a mosque
stands tomorrow. The warlike, manly spirit of this religion
is more intelligible to the Negro than the doctrine of
pity, which merely takes away his respect for the whites;
and the Christian priest is suspected above all because he
represents a white ruling race, against which Mohammedan
propaganda, political rather than dogmatic,¹ directs
itself with cool decision.

This general Coloured Revolution over the whole earth
marches under the disguise of very varied tendencies:
national, economic, social. It directs itself now against the
white governments of colonial empires (India) or of its
own land (the Cape), now against a white upper stratum
(Chili), now against the power of the pound or the dollar
— any alien economic system, in fact. It may even be
found opposing its own financial world for doing business
with the whites (China), or its own aristocracy or monarchy.
Religious motives also contribute: hatred of Christianity
or of any form of priesthood and orthodoxy whatever,
of manners and customs, world outlook, and moral.

Mutiny, and the revolt of the Mexicans against the Emperor 
Maximilian, there will be found, deep down, everywhere 
one and the same thing; hatred of the white race 
and an unconditional determination to destroy it. As to 
whether age-old, weary Civilizations like the Indian and 
the Chinese can preserve order without foreign rule, nobody 
cares. All that matters is whether they are in a position 
to throw off the white yoke, and that is the case. Who 
will be the next sovereign over the coloured powers — 
Russia, Japan, or some great adventurer with an armed 
host at his back — will be decided later, or perhaps not at 
all. The ancient Egyptian Civilization changed its rulers 
many times after 1000 B.C. — Libyans, Assyrians, Persians, 
Greeks, Romans. It was never again capable of self-
government, but always equal to a new and victorious revolt. 
And whether even one of the many other aims is 
being or will be realized is for the moment quite beside 
the point. The great historical question is whether the fall 
of the white powers will be brought about or not. And on 
this point the overwhelming unity of resolve that has 
formed itself may well give us something to think about. 
What resources of spiritual and material power can the 
white world really muster against this menace?

Very few, it would seem at the first glance. For one thing, 
its peoples are weary of their Culture. Spiritual substance 
has consumed itself in the fire of high form and the striving 
after inward perfection, in very many cases only the

glow is left, in many only ashes, but it is not so everywhere. 
The less a nation has been called upon to lead in the whirlwind 
of history in the past, the more has it retained of the 
chaos which may become form. And when the storm of 
great events rushes over it, as in 1914, hidden sparks 
suddenly burst into flame. Precisely in the Germanic race, 
the strongest-willed that has ever existed, great possibilities 
lie sleeping. 

But in speaking of race, it is not intended in the sense 
in which it is the fashion among anti-Semites in Europe 
and America to use it today: Darwinistically, materially. 
Race purity is a grotesque word in view of the fact that 
for centuries all stocks and species have been mixed, and 
that warlike — that is, healthy — generations with a future 
before them have from time immemorial always welcomed 
a stranger into the family if he had “race,” to whatever 
race it was he belonged. Those who talk too much 
about race no longer have it in them. What is needed is 
not a pure race, but a strong one, which has a nation 
within it. 

This manifests itself above all in self-evident elemental 
fecundity, in an abundance of children, which historical 
life can consume without ever exhausting the supply. God 
is, in the familiar words of Frederick the Great, always on 
the side of the big battalions, and now if ever this shows 
itself. The millions who fell in the World War were the 
pick of all that the white world had in the way of race, but 
the test of race is the speed with which it can replace 
itself. A Russian once said to me: “The Russian woman

will make good in ten years what we sacrificed in the 
Revolution.” That is the right instinct. Such races are 
irresistible. The trivial doctrine of Malthus, preached 
everywhere today, which extols barrenness as progress, only 
proves that these intellectuals have no “race,” not to men-
tion the idiotic idea that economic crises can be surmounted 
by an atrophied population. It is just the other way round. 
The “big battalions,” without which there is no world 
policy, give protection, strength, and internal riches to the 
economic life also. 

A woman of race does not desire to be a “companion” 
or a “lover,” but a mother; and not the mother of one 
child, to serve as a toy and distraction, but of many: the 
instinct of a strong race speaks in the pride that large 
families inspire, in the feeling that barrenness is the hard-
est curse that can befall a woman and through her the race. 
Out of this instinct arises the primitive jealousy which 
leads one woman to take away from another the man whom 
she covets as the father of her children. The more 
intellectual jealousy of the great cities, which is little more than 
erotic appetite and looks upon the other party as a means 
of pleasure, and even the mere fact of considering the 
desired or dreaded number of children who are to be born, 
betrays the waning of the race urge to permanence; and 
that instinct for permanence cannot be reawakened by 
speeches and writing. Primitive marriage, or whatever 
other deep-rooted folk-custom has ever been practised to 
sanctify procreation, was anything but sentimental. A man 
wants stout sons who will perpetuate his name and his

deeds beyond his death into the future and enhance them,
just as he has done himself through feeling himself heir
to the calling and works of his ancestors. That is the Nordic
idea of immortality. These peoples have known no other
and desired none. It is the source of that tremendous yearning
for fame, the wish to live on among posterity through
one’s work, to see one’s name perpetuated on monuments
or at the least held in honourable memory. For this reason
the inheritance idea is inseparable from Germanic marriage.
When the notion of property crumbles away, the
meaning of the family fades into nothingness. He who
lays hands on the one attacks the other too. The idea of
inheritance, which is inherent in the life of every farm,
every workshop, every old-established firm, and all inherited
callings,^ and has found its highest symbolical expression in
hereditary monarchy, is the guarantee of strong
race-instincts. Not only is it untouched by Socialism; its
very existence signifies Socialism’s downfall.

But the decay of the white family, the inevitable outcome
of megalopolitan existence, is spreading, and it is devouring
the “race” of nations. The meaning of man and
wife, the will to perpetuity, is being lost. People live for
themselves alone, not for future generations. The nation
as society, once the organic web of families, threatens to
dissolve, from the city outwards, into a sum of private
atoms, of which each is intent on extracting from his own
and other lives the maximum of amusement — panem

the basis of all nobilities, patriciates, and guilds.

et circenses. The women’s emancipation of Ibsen’s time
wanted, not freedom from the husband, but freedom from
the child, from the burden of children, just as men’s
emancipation in the same period signified freedom from
the duties towards family, nation, and State. The whole
of Liberal-Socialistic problem-literature revolves about
this suicide of the white race. It has been the same in all
other Civilizations.^

The consequences lie before us. The coloured races of
the world have up till now been twice as strong numerically
as the white. But about 1930 Russia had an annual
excess of births of four million, Japan of two million; and
India, between 1921 and 1931, increased her population
by thirty-four million. In Africa the extraordinarily prolific
Negro population will increase still more enormously
now that European medicine has been introduced to check
disease, which was so strong a selective factor. In contrast
to this, Germany and Italy have a surplus of births of less
than half a million, England — the country of publicly
encouraged birth control — less than half this amount, and
France and the old-established Yankee element in the
United States^ none at all. This Yankee element, until
now the dominant “race” of Germanic stamp, has been
rapidly dwindling for some decades. The increase of population
comes entirely^ from the side of the Negroes and
emigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe since 1900.

their population in the last fifty years. In certain cases 
the birth-rate is only half the death-rate. There are small 
towns and villages which are almost empty. From the 
South there is an influx of Catalonians and Italians as 
land-workers. Poles and Negroes are found in every grade, 
even the middle classes. There are black clergymen, offi-
cers, and judges. It is these prolific immigrants, account-
ing for a tenth of the population, who alone keep the num-
ber of “ Frenchmen ” up to anything approaching the old 
level. But the genuine Frenchman will soon be no longer 
master in France. The apparent increase of the white popu-
lation all over the world, little as it is in comparison with 
the volume of the coloured increase, rests upon a temporary 
illusion; the number of children grows ever smaller, and 
only the number of adults increases, not because there are 
more of them, but because they live longer. 

But a strong race requires not only an inexhaustible 
birth-rate, but also a severe selection process, which is 
provided by the resistances to living represented by mis-
fortune, sickness, and war. Nineteenth-century medicine, 
a true product of Rationalism, is from this point of view 
also a phenomenon of age. It prolongs each life whether 
this is desirable or no. It prolongs even death. It replaces 
the number of children by the number of greybeards. It 
promotes the world outlook of panem et circenses by esti-
mating the value of life by the number of its days, not by 
their usefulness. It prevents the natural process of selec-
tion and thereby accentuates the decay of the race. The 
number of incurable mental cases in England and Wales 

[223] 

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

has increased during twenty years from 4.6 to 8.6 per thou-
sand. In Germany the number of the feeble-minded is al-
most half a million, in the United States over a million. 
According to a report sponsored by ex-President Hoover, 
the youth of America has a record of 1,360,000 with hear-
ing impaired or “ so defective in speech that they require 
remedial treatment and training,” 1,000,000 with “ weak 
or damaged hearts,” 675,000 presenting “ behavior prob-
lems,” 450,000 “ mentally retarded to such a degree that 
they require special education,” 300,000 cripples, and 
60,000 “ blind or in need of sight-saving instruction.” 
But added to these are the terrible numbers of abnormal 
people of every description, mental, spiritual, and physi-
cal, the hysterical, moral, and nerve cases who can neither 
beget nor bear healthy children. Their number is unobtain-
able, but we can gauge it by the number of doctors who 
live by them and the mass of books that are written about 
them. From this degenerate crop comes the revolutionary 
proletariat, with its hatred born of grievances, and the 
drawing-room Bolshevism of the aesthetes and literary folk, 
who enjoy and advertise the attractiveness of such states 
of mind. 

It is a well-known fact that important persons are sel-
dom first children and almost never only ones. The mar-
riage that is poor in offspring is a menace not only to the 
quantity but to the quality of the race. What a nation 
needs quite as badly as a healthy race is the existence of 
an elite to lead it. But an elite such as that formed by the 
oversea civil service in England and the officer-corps in

Prussia — or, for that matter, the Catholic Church —  
which unwaveringly, and in total disregard of money or  
origins, upheld its ethic and made good in difficult situa-  
tions, becomes impossible when the available material  
rises nowhere above the average. Life’s selection must have  
taken precedence of it; only then can the class selec-  
tion take place. A strong stock demands strong parents.  
Something of the barbarism of past ages must still be  
present in the blood beneath the strict form of an old Cul-  
ture, ready to surge up in difficult times, to save and to  
conquer.  

Barbarism is that which I call strong race,' the eternal  
warlike in the type of the beast-of-prey man. It often seems  
to have ceased to exist, but it is crouching in the soul  
ready to spring. Given a big challenge — and it is on top  
of the enemy. It is dead only where Late urban pacifism,  
with its weary desire for peace at any price, short of that  
of its own life, has rolled its mud over the generations.  
That is the spiritual self-disarmament, following on the  
physical, which comes of unfruitfulness.  

Why is the German people the least exhausted of the  
white world, and therefore the one on which may be placed  
the most hope? Because its political past has given it no  
opportunity to waste its precious blood and its great abili-  
ties. This is the one blessed aspect of our wretched history  
since 1500: it has used us sparingly. It turned us into  
dreamers and theoreticians in matters of world policy,

made us ignorant of the world, narrow, quarrelsome, and 
provincial; but that can be got over. It was no organic 
defect, no inherent lack of ability — the days of the Holy 
Roman Empire are there to show that. Good blood, the 
foundation of every kind of intellectual as well as physical 
superiority, there was and still is. Great history is exacting. 
It devours the racially best elements. It devoured ancient 
Rome in a few centuries. The Nordic migrations, 
which had come to a standstill in Southern Europe a thousand 
years before, set in again on the grand scale on the 
discovery of America, taking oceans in their stride. Vigorous 
Spanish families, of predominantly Nordic origin, 
migrated in numbers to the new continent, where they 
could fight, explore, and rule. By about 1800 the best 
aristocracy of the Spanish stamp was there and vigorous 
life had died out in the mother country. Similarly the 
class in France whose vocation was to rule was used up 
by high policy from Louis XIII onwards — and not by 
that alone, for high Culture must be paid for dearly too. 
And the Anglo-Saxon has been used up even more by the 
British Empire. What there was of higher material there 
did not find its way into counting-houses and minor official 
posts, but followed the Viking urge to a life of danger and 
wandered to all parts of the globe, either meeting its end 
in innumerable adventures, and wars or succumbing to the 
effects of climate, or remaining abroad to establish, as in 
North America, the foundation of a new ruling class. What 
was left became “ conservative,” by which in this case is 
meant uncreative, tired, full of ... unproductive hatred of

THE COLOURED WORLD-REVOLUTION

everything new and unforeseen. Germany, too, has lost
a great deal of its best blood in foreign armies and to
foreign nations. But the provincialism of its political
conditions toned down the ambitions of young talent to service
at small courts, in small armies and administrations.^
These settled down to form a healthy and prolific middle
class. The nobility remained, for the most part a superior
peasantry. There was no high society and no fullness of
life. “Race,” in the people, was asleep, waiting for the
call of a great age. But in this people there lies, notwithstanding
the devastations of the last decades, a store of
excellent blood such as no other nation possesses. It can
be roused and must be spiritualized to meet the stupendous
tasks before it. The battle for the planet has begun. The
pacifism of the century of Liberalism must be overcome
if we are to go on living.

How far in fact have the white nations advanced towards
pacifism? Is the outcry against war an intellectual gesture
or a serious abdication from history at the cost of dignity,
honour, liberty? Yet life is war. Can we dismiss its meaning
and yet retain it? That is what the craving for the
peace of fellahdom, for protection against everything that
disturbs the daily routine, against destiny in every form,
would seem to intimate: a sort of protective mimicry vis-à-vis
world history, human insects feigning death in the
face of danger, the “happy ending” of an empty existence,
the boredom of which has brought in jazz music

^ Except in the Habsburg State, which likewise diluted and tamed the
German stock within its boundaries.“

and Negro dancing to perform the Dead March for a great
Culture.

But this cannot, must not, be. The hare may perhaps
deceive the fox, but human beings cannot deceive each
other. The coloured man sees through the white man when
he talks about “humanity” and everlasting peace. He
scents the other’s unfitness and lack of will to defend himself.
This is why a great educational effort is essential:
what I have called “Prussian,” but which may, for all I
care, call itself “Socialist” — what’s in a word? It must
be education which rouses the sleeping energy not by
schooling, science, or culture, but by living example, by
soul discipline, which fetches up what is still there,
strengthens it, and causes it to blossom anew. We cannot
permit ourselves to be tired. Danger is knocking at the
door. The coloured races are not pacifists. They do not
cling to a life whose length is its sole value. They take up
the sword when we lay it down. Once they feared the white
man; now they despise him. Our judgment stands written
in their eyes when men and women comport themselves
in their presence as they do, at home or in the lands of
colour themselves. Once they were filled with terror at
our power — as were the Germanic people before the first
Roman legions. Today, when they are themselves a power,
their mysterious soul for which we shall never understand
— rises up and looks down upon the whites as on a thing of
yesterday.

The greatest danger has not yet been even named.
What if, one day, class war and race war joined forces

THE COLOURED WORLD-REVOLUTION

to make an end of the white world? This lies in the nature
of things, and neither of the two Revolutions will disdain
the aid of the other simply because it despises its supporters.
A common hate extinguishes mutual contempt. And
what if some white adventurer — and there have been
many such — whose wild soul cannot breathe in the hothouse
of civilization and seeks to satiate its love of danger
in fantastic colonial ventures, among pirates, in the Foreign
Legion — should suddenly see this grand goal staring
him in the face? It is through such natures that history
springs her great surprises. The loathing of deep and
strong men for our conditions and the hatred of profoundly
disillusioned men might well grow into a revolt that meant
to annihilate. This was not unknown in Caesar’s time. In
any case: when the white proletariat breaks loose in the
United States, the Negro will be on the spot, and behind
him Indians and Japanese will await their hour. Similarly
a black France would have little hesitation in outdoing
the Parisian horrors of 1792 and 1871. And would
the white leaders of the class war ever hesitate if coloured
outbreaks opened up a way for them? They have never
been fastidious in the means they use. It would make no
difference if the voice of Moscow ceased to dictate. It has
done its work, and the work goes forward of itself. We have
waged our wars and class wars before the eyes of colour,
have humiliated and betrayed each other; we have even
summoned it to take part in them. Would it be anything to
wonder at if at last coloured were to act on its own account?

At this point advancing history towers high over eco-

THE HOUR OF DECISION 

Economic distress and internal political ideals. The elemental 
forces of life are themselves entering the fight, which is 
for all or nothing. The prefiguration of Caesarism will soon 
become clearer, more conscious and unconcealed. The 
masks will fall completely from the age of the parliamentary 
interlude. All attempts to gather up the content of 
the future into parties will soon be forgotten. The Fascist 
formations of this decade will pass into new, unforeseeable 
forms, and even present-day nationalism will disappear. 
There remains as a formative power only the warlike, 
“ Prussian ” spirit — everywhere and not in Germany 
alone. Destiny, once compacted in meaningful forms and 
great traditions, will now proceed to make history in terms 
of formless individual powers. Caesar’s legions are returning 
to consciousness. 

Here, possibly even in our own century, the ultimate decisions 
are waiting for their man. In presence of these the 
little aims and notions of our current politics sink to nothing. 
He whose sword compels victory here will be lord 
of the world. The dice are there ready for this stupendous 
game. Who dares to throw them?

SOME BOOKS OF INTEREST 


Germany’s Third Empire 
by MOELLER VAN DEN BRUCK 

AUTHORISED ENGLISH TRANSLATION (CONDENSED) BY E. O. LORIMER 

This is a translation from the third complete edition of the famous work 
Das Dritte Reich which has sold over 100,000 copies in Germany. In this 
book the author, a well-known historian, investigates the causes of Germany’s 
“collapse,” the principles of each political school of thought from “Revolutionary” 
to “Reactionary,” the breakdown of Marxism, and the remedies 
for Germany’s ills. Convinced that “the German Nation has a mission in 
Europe that no other people can fulfil” he examines the aims and ideals 
which he thinks should be a guide in constructing a New Germany. These 
throw considerable light on the mentality of the German people to-day. 

Here are a few of his striking comments; 

“Parliaments fetter a nation’s liberty.” 

“We must enquire why we lost in the political field a war which on every 
battlefield we won.” 

“The peace did not bring freedom but slavery — and not even peace.” 

“We have 20 million surplus population who cannot live. We must burst 
our frontiers and take the space that we require.” 

Demy 8vo. 10s. 6d. 


Germany Under the Treaty 
by W. H. DAWSON 

This is a critical discussion of the territorial provisions of the Treaty of 
Versailles, of the spirit in which they, with the other punitive stipulations 
of the Treaty, were approached and executed, of the reasons advanced in 
their justification, where reasons were given at all, and of the effects for the 
populations concerned which have followed and may be seen to-day in the 
territories annexed, the adjacent German frontier districts, and in the country 
at large. Mr. Dawson's book not only covers the whole ground, but it is based 
on thorough and exhaustive study recently made on the spot. Much that is 
new will be found in the two introductory chapters, “The Versailles Conference” 
and “The Treaty of Versailles”; and other chapters contain a careful 
survey of present social and economic conditions in the frontier districts 

“An important and a timely book. Mr. Dawson writes with recognized 
authority on German affairs, and those who look to him to explain the nature 
of the great wave of opinion which has carried Herr Hitler into power will 
not be disappointed.” — Times Literary Supplement 

book which all Englishmen would do well to read, especially just now.” 
— Truth.

Christianity is Pacifism 
by W. ROBINSON 

“As good a case for pacifism as can be made on the ground of Scripture

The Progress of International Government 
by DAVID MITRANY, D.Sc., Ph.D. 

This is a study of the gradual evolution of International Government. The 
author deals with his subject under the following headings: “International 
Government in Perspective,” “Realities in State Equality,” “The Communal 
Organisation of World Affairs,” “Authority in the World of States.” 

“Progress,” writes the author, “has been laborious and, on the whole, unaided 
by human reason. Yet therein lies the true lesson of its story. It shows that 
our present experiments are not the playthings of some visionary mind. 
They are rather the highest ledge reached so far in an evolution which, in 
broad outline, has been consistent and continuous . . . Whatever the trials 
and disappointments of the present generation, therefore, they can build 
confidently upon the line of development which I have tried to bring into 
relief, along which the present experiments, whatever their material fate, 
are ineradicable landmarks.” 

“A notably interesting account of the history of political thought and practice 
in the post-mediaeval era . . . Mr. Mitrany’s clarity of view, the acuteness 
of his political analysis, his frank facing of difficulties, and his shrewd advocacy 
of the League of Nations idea gives his book a value which will be the more 
appreciated the more widely and carefully it is read.” — Scots Observer.

War, Sadism, and Pacifism 
by EDWARD GLOVER, M.D. 

In this book the problem of War is approached from an entirely fresh angle. 
The author maintains that the issue is fundamentally a psychological one. 
He holds that objective investigation of War involves a thorough examination 
of the phenomena of Pacifism. Proceeding on this assumption he shows that 
to a very large extent Pacifist energies and War impulses have a common 
origin. Hence the inefficiency or inefficacy of Pacifist propaganda. The principles 
of war-prevention are analysed in detail and a reasoned outline of 
research appended. 

“It would be hard to find a more stimulating and constructive treatment 
of a problem of universal interest.” — Lancet
